== Funding ==

We have more travel funding than in the past (airfare and lodging, not food).  If you are involved with Sage, or allied projects, in an educational setting and have a project to work on during the workshop, send a request for funding, with details, to Rob Beezer, beezer@ups.edu.

Anyone with any interest in the use of Sage in educational settings is welcome, and encouraged to attend, with or without funding.

== Projects ==

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be:

 * Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course.
 * Preparing worksheets for a course.
 * Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library.
 * Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.
 * (wstein): Work on my free open Sage book: http://code.google.com/p/sage-power-book/

 * Organization of Sage educational resources
  * rating of worksheets?
  * tagging, organization of available options
  * suggestion from chemistry: set up committees to curate resources so that faculty get service credit
