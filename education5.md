= Sage Education Days 5 =

The fifth [[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage]] Education Days will be held in conjunction with [[days48|Sage Days 48]], at the University of Washington in Seattle, June 19-21, 2013.

Funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Undergraduate Education.

<<TableOfContents>>


== Funding ==

We have more travel funding than in the past (airfare and lodging, not food).  If you are involved with Sage, or allied projects, in an educational setting and have a project to work on during the workshop, send a request for funding, with details, to Rob Beezer, beezer@ups.edu.

Anyone with any interest in the use of Sage in educational settings is welcome, and encouraged to attend, with or without funding.


== Logistics ==

 * At the [[http://www.washington.edu|University of Washington]] Seattle campus (on the west coast of the US, not Washington, DC).
 * June 19, 20 and 21 are expected to be full days.  So plan to travel on June 18 and June 22.
 * Campus location:  We have [[http://www.css.washington.edu/room/MEB+246|MEB 246]] and [[http://www.css.washington.edu/room/MEB+248|MEB 248]] reserved in the [[http://www.washington.edu/students/maps/map.cgi?MEB|Mechanical Engineering Building]] for the week's events.
 * [[days48|Sage Days 48]] will happen the same week at the University of Washington with the Notebook Development as its theme.
 * '''Be sure to buy your plane ticket on a US carrier.'''
 * See the [[uw-local-info|local information page]] for more specifics.


== Lodging ==

Arrangements for rooms at [[http://www.hoteldeca.com/|Hotel Deca]] have been made.  Please see the [[days48/travel|travel page]] for exact details on reserving a room at a special rate.


== Mailing Lists ==

 * The mailing list for [[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sagedays48|Sage Days 48]],  will be used for Education Days also.  Please add yourself to this list if you are not already on it.  This will be the primary vehicle for announcements, and last-minute changes during the week.

 * There is also a list specifically for discussing [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu|education and Sage]].

== Blog Roll ==

[[http://mathematicseducationissues.blogspot.com/|Tom Judson]]


== IRC ==

 * There is an IRC channel for sage days: #sagemath-days on irc.freenode.net. Feel free to join to discuss whatever...   For those without IRC clients, http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days


== Projects ==

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be:

 * Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course.
 * Preparing worksheets for a course.
 * Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library.
 * Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.

=== Jason Aubrey, Mike Gage, John Travis ===
 * Finishing at least one of the SAGE-WeBWorK bridges; hopefully the one that allows webwork problem authors to include SAGE code in webwork problems for computations and other fun. 

=== Greg Bard ===
 * Making videos suitable for 100-level students to use SAGE in calculus, finite math, statistics, linear algebra, etc... (even precalculus?)

=== Rob Beezer ===
 * Keep workshop organized
 * Document my finitely-generated abelian groups patch [[#9773|http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9773]]
 * Generate a killer worksheet for [http://cloud.sagemath.org/|Salvus]] from XML source

=== Martin Flashman ===
  *Work on a project for visualizing functions using mapping diagrams (aka dynagraphs) for a teaching resource on the subject for beginning algebra through calculus using SAGE.
  *Work with others on how to make these visualizations easy to create making it part of a SAGE toolbox/workspace/workbook.
  *Learn how to embed SAGE in other materials- especially for my on-line calculus book. [[http://users.humboldt.edu/flashman/senscalca_x.html|(The Sensible Calculus Book)]]

=== Andrey Novoseltsev ===
 * Figure out the best way for public posting of Sage applets like [[http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~novoseltsev/2013Winter215Q1/MI06_three_iterated_integrals_public.html|Three Iterated Integrals]] or [[http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~novoseltsev/2013Winter215Q1/VC01_vector_fields_public.html|Vector Field Plotter]]
 * Work on issues preventing these applets from working within Sage notebook, e.g. [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14020|#14020 Broken layout]]
 * Figure out the best way for public posting of Sage worksheets using "modules for teaching" like [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14288|#14288 Interactive Simplex Method]]

=== David Perkinson ===
  * Work on a Sage package for hyperplane arrangements.

=== S Singleton ===
 * Develop new worksheets that complement current [[http://www.pogil.org/resources/curriculum-materials| POGIL curriculum materials]]
 * See if a physical chemistry course with "no calculus by hand" is feasible (traditional approaches involving multivariable calculus is problematic for some students).
 * Utilize @interacts for exploratory worksheets.

=== William Stein ===
 * Work on my free open Sage book: http://code.google.com/p/sage-power-book/

=== Karl-Dieter Crisman ===
 * Work on cleaning up HTML and organization etc. for my [[http://www.math.gordon.edu/~kcrisman/mat338|number theory book]]
 * Develop resources for people wanting to make Sage-enabled lecture notes?
 * Review tons of tickets
 * More stuff?

=== Jeff Denny ===
 * Create collection of Sage widgets for teaching calculus
 * Build these into a database similar to the one at http://sagemath.org/eval.html

=== TJ Hitchman ===
 * Work on linear algebra IBL course notes using Sage
 * Make short "intro to cloud.sagemath.com" for students
 * learn about sage development process
