Welcome to the Sage developer center!

This wiki page helps in organizing the development of Sage. Information and links to Sage development should be organized under "devel/". For answers to commonly asked questions, see the [[faq | FAQ]].

Note: The [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ |trac server]] contains patches awaiting review. Michael Abshoff wrote a set of [[devel/TracGuidelines | general guidelines]] for using the trac server. See also the [[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/trac.html | Developers' Guide]] for further information on using the trac patch server.
