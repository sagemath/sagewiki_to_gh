Welcome to the '''Sage developer center'''!

This wiki page helps in organizing the development of Sage. Information and links to Sage development should be organized under "devel/". For answers to commonly asked questions, see the [[faq | FAQ]].

Note: The [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ |trac server]] contains patches awaiting review. Michael Abshoff wrote a set of [[devel/TracGuidelines | general guidelines]] for using the trac server. See also the [[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/trac.html | Developers' Guide]] for further information on using the trac patch server.

= Release management =

Each release cycle of Sage is managed by at least one release manager. For example, a release manager produces the various alpha and rc releases for the `sage-x.y.z` release cycle. Release management is a complex task. The [[release | release management]] page contains a rough set of guidelines for Sage release management. If you want to help out with release management, please subscribe to the [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release | sage-release]] mailing list.
