This may be more of a work-in-progress than a formal SEP, but I\'m not sure where else to put it.

Basically, we now have inconsistency of what functions are defined for what matrix types. This makes things confusing to students, for example; when they are doing a problem, often a matrix will be coerced into a new type, which then has a different set of functions.
