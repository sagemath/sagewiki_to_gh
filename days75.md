Sage Days 75 will be held from August 22-26, 2016 at [[https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/saclay|Inria Saclay]], France.

<<TableOfContents()>>

= Organizers =

Daniel Augot, David Lucas, Johan S. R. Nielsen, Clément Pernet.

Please contact David Lucas (david.lucas[at]inria.fr) for any question.

= Focus & Topics =

The overall theme of this Sage Days is coding theory and exact linear algebra related to it, but there will be lots of general hacking.
Even if you don't have any particular interest in coding theory, you should participate! 
Similarly, even if don't know Sage at all but are interested in coding theory, you should also participate!
There will be an installation session, introductory talks to Sage and its development workflow.

The aim of this Sage Days is to:

 * Introduce Sage to coding theorists.

 * Have presentations about the enhancements we made to Sage's coding theory library during Inria's [[https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/wiki/Home|ACTIS]] project

 * Help people to work on their own projects.

We plan on having talks on the mornings, and coding sprints on the afternoons.
The first 3 days' talks will be focused on basic functionalities of our library, the last 2 days
on advanced functionalities, with an emphasis on Sage development.
