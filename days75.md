Sage Days 75 will be held from August 22-26, 2016 at [[https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/saclay|Inria Saclay]], France.

= Organizers =

Daniel Augot, David Lucas, Johan S. R. Nielsen, Clément Pernet.

Please contact David Lucas (david.lucas[at]inria.fr) for any question.

= Focus & Topics =

The overall theme of this Sage Days is coding theory, but there will be lots of general hacking.
Even if you don't have any particular interest in coding theory, you should participate! 

The aim of this Sage Days is to:

 * Introduce Sage to coding theorists.

 * Have presentations about the enhancements we made to Sage's coding theory library during Inria's [[https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/wiki/Home|ACTIS]] project

 * Help people to work on their own projects.

We plan on having talks on the mornings, and coding sprints on the afternoons.
The first 3 days' talks will be focused on basic functionalities of our library, the last 2 days
on advanced functionalities, with an emphasis on Sage development.

== Schedule ==

TBA

== Ideas for hacking projects ==

Feel free to add your own ideas here.

* Review any open coding theory ticket, see [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18846|#18846]].

* Fix smaller issues with `linear_code.py` as noted on the [[https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/issues/155/problems-with-linear_codepy|ACTIS Bitbucket wiki]].

* Improve integration of finite field non-prime basis representation introduced in [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20284|#20284]].

* Port implementation of asymptotically fast (GF(q)[x])[y] root-finding from [[https://bitbucket.org/jsrn/codinglib|Codinglib]].

* Fix and review [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16742|#16742]] regarding faster F[x] matrix reduction.

* Link to advanced fast polynomial arithmetic library functions such as multi-point evaluation and Lagrange interpolation.

* Link to fast GF(2)[x] library (currently used is NTL generic GF(p)[x]).

* Link to new features of new LinBox release.

* Cython implementation of the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm for computing the minimum distance of a linear code.
