# Organizers

Daniel Augot, David Lucas, Johan S. R. Nielsen, Clément Pernet. 

Please contact David Lucas (david.lucas[at]inria.fr) for any question. 


# Focus & Topics

The overall theme of this Sage Days is coding theory and exact linear algebra related to it, but there will be lots of general hacking. Even if you don't have any particular interest in coding theory, you should participate!  Similarly, even if don't know Sage at all but are interested in coding theory, you should also participate! There will be an installation session, introductory talks to Sage and its development workflow. 

The aim of this Sage Days is to: 

* Introduce Sage to coding theorists. 
* Have presentations about the enhancements we made to Sage's coding theory library during Inria's <a class="https" href="https://bitbucket.org/lucasdavid/sage_coding_project/wiki/Home">ACTIS</a> project 
* Help people to work on their own projects. 
We plan on having talks on the mornings, and coding sprints on the afternoons. The first 3 days' talks will be focused on basic functionalities of our library, the last 2 days on advanced functionalities, with an emphasis on Sage development.

## Activity during the SageDays

<a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&amp;status=needs_info&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_work&amp;status=new&amp;status=positive_review&amp;keywords=~sd75&amp;order=priority">tickets related to the sage-days</a> 

<a class="https" href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/days75/status-report">status report</a> 

Wee used a short-lived <a class="https" href="https://mensuel.framapad.org">collaborative Framapad</a> for dynamically tracking status during the Sage Days. Each day ended with a status meeting where everyone said what they had worked on and were currently working on. 


# Logistics


## Lodging

We booked a holiday cottage (<a class="http" href="http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/de-toren/">The Tower</a> and <a class="http" href="http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/le-grenier-royal/">Le grenier royal</a> and will provide free lodging.
