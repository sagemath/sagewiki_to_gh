= Focus & Topics =

The aim of this Sage Days is to:

 * introduce Sage to coding theorists

 * have presentations about the enhancements we made to Sage's coding theory library during Inria's ACTIS [link] project

 * help people to work on their projects

Anyone, even without any particular interest to coding theory can participate! 
We plan on having talks on the mornings, and coding sprints on the afternoons.
The first 3 days' talks will be focused on basic functionalities of our library, the last 2 days
on advanced functionalities, with an emphasis on Sage development.
