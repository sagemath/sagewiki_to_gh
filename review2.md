=== Objectives ===

The purpose of this workshop will be threefold.

 * Review some of the 278 tickets currently needing review.
 * Come up with a way to ensure that critical tickets [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11358|like this]] don't get lost beneath the radar. 
 * Improve Sage's review and testing infrastructure.  
   * Set up a system that allows line by line comments (like Google's internal Mondrian system, or the open source versions Rietveld or Review Board)
   * Implement a system requiring authors of tickets to suggest a reviewer (while providing defaults)
