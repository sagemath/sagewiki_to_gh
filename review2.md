= Sage Review Days 2: Seattle, WA =

== March 17-22, University of Washington ==

The purpose of this workshop will be twofold.
 * Review some of the 275 tickets currently needing review.
 * Improve Sage's review and testing infrastructure.  This may include setting up a system that allows line by line comments (like Google's internal Perforce system, or the open source versions Rietveld or Review Board), requiring authors of tickets to suggest a reviewer and setting up systems to provide defaults, fixing patchbot and finishing the new doctesting code (#12415)
