<<TableOfContents()>>

This 4-day workshop includes a combination of mathematical talks, Sage tutorials, and Sage development. The main goal is to promote and improve the dynamical systems functionality in Sage and to expand the scope of the database of dynamical systems. Users new to Sage and Sage development are welcome. There is no initial knowledge needed, everyone is welcome whether they are new Sage learners or Sage expert. We believe in diversity in backgrounds and experiences.

This event is funded by NSF-DMS grant [[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1906266|1906266]].

== Projects ==

See the [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/dynamics/ArithmeticAndComplex|dynamics wiki]] page for information on the current status of Dynamical Systems in Sage. The list of topics for the workshop will be decided during the first day of the conference based on the interested an areas of expertise of the participants. The following are possibilities:

 * Fix bugs
 * Improve documentation and tutorials
 * Implement new functionality
   * Potentially Good and Critically Good Reduction
   * Normal forms for maps
   * Reduced form for morphisms in dimension greater than 1
   * critical point for endomorphisms of subvarieties
   * height pairings
 * [[https://mathstat.slu.edu/~hutzba/search.php | Database of dynamical systems]]
   * Improve the search interface
   * Add new data

== Preworkshop Preparation ==

 * Obtain a github account
 * Install the latest beta version of SAGE from source code using GIT: [[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/index.html|Sage Developer's Guide]] (this may take several hours)
 * Review the dynamical systems [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/quickref/ | Reference Card]]

Please contact one of the organizers if you are having trouble with the preworkshop steps. It will be possible to do these on the first day of the workshop, but building Sage from soure code takes many hours on most computers and needs to be completed before any work can be done.
