= Sage Days 53: Computational Number Theory, Geometry, and Physics =


Our primary goal at this workshop is to implement the computation of zeta functions of toric varieties, hypersurfaces, and complete intersections, which would vastly extend Sage’s zeta function computing capabilities beyond curves. 
A second goal for the workshop is to extend cohomology computations from toric line bundles to hypercohomology of complexes of (sums of) toric line bundles. For this, we want to extend the sparse matrix capabilities in Sage and combine it with CHomP’s discrete morse complex implementation.



== Particulars ==

  * The workshop will run September 23-29, 2013, which is right before the [[http://www.claymath.org/workshops/NTP/|Clay Research Conference on "Number Theory and Physics"]]. 
  * The first day (September 23) will feature an introduction to Sage for new users
  * The remaining time (September 24-29) will be a "traditional" Sage Days workshop with emphasis on code development
  * Everything will take place at the University of Oxford in the new Mathematical Institute building (UK)
  * We are funded by the [[http://www.claymath.org|Clay Mathematics Institute]]. If you are interested in participating, please let us know! 
  * More information can be found on the [[http://www.claymath.org/workshops/CNTGP/|CMI home page for this workshop]].
