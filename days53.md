= Computational Number Theory, Geometry, and Physics (Sage Days 53) =

Our primary goal at this workshop would be to implement the computation of zeta functions of toric varieties, hypersurfaces, and complete intersections, which would vastly extend Sage’s zeta function computing capabilities beyond curves. A second goal for the workshop is to extend cohomology computations from toric line bundles to hypercohomology of complexes of (sums of) toric line bundles. For this, we want to extend the sparse matrix capabilities in Sage and combine it with CHomP’s discrete morse complex implementation.
