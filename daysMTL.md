# Sage Days 95: Women In Sage


##### July 9-13, 2018, Montréal, Canada


## Target Audience

The Women in <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> Days aim to initiate women from various backgrounds to <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> use and development, as well as to build networks between established users of mathematical software and mathematicians with potential to use such software. We do not focus on any specific area of mathematics and want to involve women at all career stages, including undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers and faculty members. Women working in industry are also welcome to apply. 

The choice to aim this event only at women was made because most developers are men, but also because we noticed intimidating attitudes from experienced men in other workshops. Even though these behaviours were probably unconscious, they have an impact on the confidence of female mathematicians when come the time of coding. To create a friendly environment, we plan to host the workshop in a rented house. Such circumstances foster longstanding connections between the participants. Because women form a minority of mathematicians, building broad and strong networks helps them to overcome the obstacles typically occurring on their career path. 


## Invited speakers

* **Tania Allard **is a research software engineer at the University of Sheffield (UK). She works with researchers to improve their code and to communicate them the general carpentry of a software. She knows well the infrastructure behind <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> and is a partner of the European <a href="/OpenDreamKit">OpenDreamKit</a> project, that aims to develop open-source pieces of software for research in mathematics. 
* **Jennifer Balakrishnan** is a number theorist and Assistant Professor at Boston University (MA) and has organized several <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> Days. She gives good talks about the use of <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> for number theorists, and is also knowledgeable about the use of <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> for other parts of mathematics. 
* **Emily Gunawan** is a postdoctoral researcher in algebra and combinatorics at University of Connecticut (CT) and is deeply involved in the Sage-Combinat development. She will talk about the implementation of frieze patterns in <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a>.

## Status reports

You can see the work that has been accomplished during the days <a class="https" href="https://etherpad.net/p/Women_in_SageMath_-_Status_reports">on this pad</a>. 


## Accommodations:

The workshop will be held in a rented house in a small town near Montreal (at one hour and a half by car). The precise location is 124 Tour du lac, in Saint-Faustin-Lac-Carré. All participants will be accommodated in the house. 


## To reach the workshop:

There will be a group departure on Sunday 8: the meeting place is at Montmorency station between 6:15 pm and 6:25 pm. Don't be late, the bus leaves at 6:27 pm! 

* Coming from Montreal downtown, take the orange line to reach the Montmorency metro station (which is the last station of the line). It takes around 40 minutes. 
* Climb the stairs and go to the bus terminal. 
* Find Pauline (a participant who will have a sign "Women in <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a>" or something similar). She will be there between 6:15 pm and 6:25 pm. Note that you don't need to buy bus tickets, Pauline will have yours with her. 
* If you are not able to find Pauline, look for bus number 9 from CITL, going to Saint-Jérôme. Pauline should be around. 
* Bus 9 takes you to Saint-Jérôme where you can take another bus to Saint-Faustin-Lac-Carré. Again, Pauline will have your tickets.  

## Tentative schedule:

The workshop will last five days and will focus on software development. 
  | Sunday  | Monday  | Tuesday  | Wednesday  | Thursday  | Friday 
9h  |   | Introduction to <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a>  | Talk by Tania Allard  | Talk by Jennifer Balakrishnan  | Talk by Emily Gunawan  | Brunch 
11h  |   | Installation  | Tutorial  | Tutorial  | Tutorial  |  
12h30  |   | Lunch  | Lunch  | Lunch  | Lunch  |  
13h30  |   |  How to contribute to <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> & Projects/teams definition  | Coding sprints  | Exercises and coding sprints  | Coding sprints and team challenges  |  
17h30  | Welcome  | Status Reports  | Status Reports  | Status Reports  | Status Reports  |  

The schedule includes three plenary talks: 

* Best practices for computational science and research, given by Tania Allard (University of Sheffield, UK) 
* <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> for number theory (even for non-number theorists), given by Jennifer Balakrishnan (Boston University, MA) 
* Conway-Coxeter friezes, cluster algebras, and <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a>, given by Emily Gunawan (University of Connecticut, CT). Download <a class="https" href="https://github.com/egunawan/talks/blob/master/frieze.ipynb">Jupyter notebook frieze.ipynb</a> and <a class="https" href="https://github.com/egunawan/talks/raw/master/days95/days95.pdf">PDF slides days95.pdf</a> 
Since one of the goal is to develop the abilities of the participants,  there will be every day coding sprints on elaborated projects.  Participants will work in teams created according to their interests. We  also plan some time for tutorials and proposed presentations in  function of the needs. Each day will end with a status report session.  Finally, we want to organize during the week a challenge where teams  will compete to conquer coding exercises. Since the workshop will be  held in a rented house, the activities will be both during the days and  evenings. Therefore, some time will also be dedicated to team-building activities. 

A more precise schedule will be announced later. 


## Registration:

Registration is now closed. 

All local expenses will be covered for participants, and candidates will be informed of the traveling support they receive with their invitation. As we could probably fund in totality the transportation expenses of only some candidates, we encourage you to apply independently to the funding you have access to.
