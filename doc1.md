# Sage Doc Day 1

This is the first of the Sage Doc Days, an attempt to improve **all** the kinds of documentation is Sage. Here are some areas that need work: 

* DOCTESTS -- This is the most obvious, as our doctest coverage is somewhere 
      * in the 33-35% range (depending on which cdef'd functions are counted, etc). 
* Manuals/Guides -- All of the guides <a class="http" href="http://www.sagemath.org/documentation.html:">here</a>  
      * could probably use some work. 
* Programming Guides -- There are several pieces of the code base (coercion model,  
      * p-adics, pexpect interfaces, the notebook, etc) that are hard to understand at a  first glance (or even a tenth glance). It would be nice if people familiar with  those sections could write a general guide for each of them. 
* Several more suggestions were made in this thread: 
      * <a class="http" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8a1b32d7339a293f/959e52081a57e914#959e52081a57e914:">sage-devel thread</a>
