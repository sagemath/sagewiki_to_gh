Thursday and Friday will be devoted to users and developers and those who want to become with lot of time for development. There is a possibility that Thursday will be reserved for solving bugs (Bug Day). Possible development projects:

== Math Computing Contest ==

There will be "Math Computing Contest" organized at the end of two days. There will be math quiz involving computations. There will be prices for the fastest and nicest solutions and also for participation. People may use whatever software they want. The show will be inspired from Star Academy and vote will be done by the audience. The goal will be to have fun and learn from each other.
