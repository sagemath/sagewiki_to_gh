= Sage Days 111 - Global Virtual Sage Modularization and Packaging Summit =

Tuesday, December 8 to Friday, December 11, 2020

An event for the !SageMath developer and packaging community

[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops|SageDays]] are gatherings of people interested in !SageMath. Sage Days have been organized as local, regional, or international in-person meetings by a wide range of people around the globe.  Because of the current global health crisis, Sage Days 111 will be a fully virtual event.

== Topics and goals ==

The main topic of the workshop is the development of the next generation of Sage packaging – a modularized Sage Library that can be installed from PyPI and whose subset distributions can map 1:1 to packages of downstream distributions.

 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29705|Meta-ticket 29705: Modularize sagelib into separate distributions (pip-installable packages)]]
     * see also [[https://researchseminars.org/talk/SageDays110/11/|Modularization and pip-installability of the Sage library]] (talk by Matthias Köppe at Sage Days 110)
 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27330|Meta-ticket 27330: spkg-configure: Try to use as many system packages as possible]]
 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30306|Meta-ticket 30306: Use system Jupyter notebook / JupyterLab]]

Participants may wish to add the keyword "sd111" to tickets that they hope to work on during Sage Days 111.

== About SageMath ==

[[https://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]], or Sage for short, is a mature, comprehensive, free (open-source) mathematics software system based on Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License, that integrates computer algebra facilities and general computational packages. 

Sage, first released in 2005, in over a decade of incubation in the  [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs|SageMath distribution, comprising 293 software packages]], has grown its own [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage|library of 1000 Cython and over 4400 Python modules]], ranging from `sage.algebras.*` over `sage.geometry.*` to `sage.tensor.*`, with a total of over 2.2 million lines of code.
