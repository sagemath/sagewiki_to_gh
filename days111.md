# Sage Days 111 - Global Virtual Sage Modularization and Packaging Summit

Tuesday, December 8 to Friday, December 11, 2020 

An event for the SageMath developer and packaging community 

<a class="https" href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops">SageDays</a> are gatherings of people interested in SageMath. Sage Days have been organized as local, regional, or international in-person meetings by a wide range of people around the globe.  Because of the current global health crisis, Sage Days 111 will be a fully virtual event. 


## Topics and goals

The main topic of the workshop is the development of the next generation of Sage packaging – a modularized Sage Library that can be installed from PyPI and whose subset distributions can map 1:1 to packages of downstream distributions.

            * see also <a class="https" href="https://researchseminars.org/talk/SageDays110/11/">Modularization and pip-installability of the Sage library</a> (talk by Matthias Köppe at Sage Days 110)

## About SageMath

<a class="https" href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, or Sage for short, is a mature, comprehensive, free (open-source) mathematics software system based on Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License, that integrates computer algebra facilities and general computational packages.  

Sage, first released in 2005, in over a decade of incubation in the  <a class="https" href="https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs">SageMath distribution, comprising 293 software packages</a>, has grown its own <a class="https" href="https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage">library of 1000 Cython and over 4400 Python modules</a>, ranging from `sage.algebras.*` over `sage.geometry.*` to `sage.tensor.*`, with a total of over 2.2 million lines of code.
