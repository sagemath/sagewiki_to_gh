## Dan Drake

I work at the <a class="http" href="http://kaist.ac.kr">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> (KAIST), although starting fall 2012 I have a one-year position at the <a class="http" href="http://pugetsound.edu">University of Puget Sound</a>. I study combinatorics. I maintain the KAIST Sage server at <a class="http" href="http://sagenb.kaist.ac.kr">sagenb.kaist.ac.kr</a>. 

I'm the main author of <a class="http" href="http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/sagetex">SageTeX</a>, a LaTeX package that allows you to integrate Sage code into your documents.  

I gave some talks at <a href="/days9">Sage Days 9</a>, and put my slides, etc, at <a href="/DanDrake/Days9Talks">/Days9Talks</a>. 

I also gave a colloquium talk on Sage at <a class="http" href="http://skku.ac.kr">Sungkyunkwan University</a>: the slides are at <a href="/DanDrake/SKKUTalk">/SKKUTalk</a>. 

I wrote some notes on setting up a (hopefully) secure Sage virtual machine using Ubuntu JeOS: <a href="/DanDrake/JustEnoughSageServer">/JustEnoughSageServer</a>. I'm also expanding the notebook() docstring at <a href="/StartingTheNotebook">StartingTheNotebook</a>; this will likely end up in the official documentation, I think. Ubuntu has dropped the whole "JeOS" thing and I should update that document. 

I was one of the organizers of <a class="http" href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/days37">Sage Days 37</a> in Seoul. 

My homepage is <a href="http://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~drake">http://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~drake</a> and my email address is ddrake at member ams org. (I trust you can put in the dots and @ properly.)
