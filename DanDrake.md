== Dan Drake ==

I'm a postdoc at the [http://kaist.ac.kr Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology] (KAIST). I study combinatorics. I'm still very new to Sage, so I'm better at asking stupid questions and breaking stuff than I am at answering questions and fixing things.

My (extremely unexciting) homepage is [http://math.kaist.ac.kr/~drake].
