== Dan Drake ==

I work at the [http://kaist.ac.kr Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology] (KAIST). I study combinatorics. I'm still relatively new to Sage, so I'm generally better at asking stupid questions and breaking stuff than I am at answering questions and fixing things...although I am working on implementing complete matchings for combinat, and I'd like to see the ability to output [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/ TikZ] code for various Sage objects for which that would make sense.

I'm the main author of [http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/sagetex SageTeX], a LaTeX package that allows you to integrate Sage code into your documents. I am working on the next version and hope to have it out sometime this autumn.

I'll be giving some talks at [:days9:Sage Days 9], and will put my slides, etc, at /Days9Talks.

My homepage is http://math.kaist.ac.kr/~drake.
