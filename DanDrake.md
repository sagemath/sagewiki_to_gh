== Dan Drake ==

I work at the [[http://kaist.ac.kr|Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST). I study combinatorics.

I'm the main author of [[http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/sagetex|SageTeX]], a LaTeX package that allows you to integrate Sage code into your documents. A new version is mostly ready, and I hope to get it in Sage soon.

I'll be giving some talks at [[days9|Sage Days 9]], and put my slides, etc, at /Days9Talks.

I also gave a colloquium talk on Sage at [[http://skku.ac.kr|Sungkyunkwan Universityh]: the slides are at /SKKUTalk.

I wrote some notes on setting up a (hopefully) secure Sage virtual machine using Ubuntu JeOS: /JustEnoughSageServer. I'm also expanding the notebook() docstring at StartingTheNotebook; this will likely end up in the official documentation, I think.

My homepage is http://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~drake.
