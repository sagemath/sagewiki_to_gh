== Computing the Cartier operator acting on 1-forms ==

  * sage worksheet that is slow and just implements algorithm (correctly!)

  * make it really, really fast. 

  * get included in sage itself

  * make a big table or something?   Rachel: "I would love to find a curve with p-rank 0 and a-number 1.   I did genus 4 and p=3."


== Making Drew Sutherland's smalljac code usable in Sage and extending Kate's data ==


  * make code usable from Python  (involves Cython)

  * use code:
 
     - replicate and extend data in Kate's talk
 
     - maybe try genus 2 analogue?
