== Computing the Cartier operator acting on 1-forms ==

PEOPLE: Rachel P., Aly, Gagan, Anja, Sarah, Marina, Kate

  * See [[days26/Pries Project|this page]].

  * sage worksheet that is slow and just implements algorithm (correctly!)

  * make it really, really fast. 

  * get included in sage itself

  * make a big table or something?   Rachel: "I would love to find a curve with p-rank 0 and a-number 1.   I did genus 4 and p=3."


== Making Drew Sutherland's smalljac code usable in Sage and extending Kate's data ==

PEOPLE: Kate, William S., Lola, Aly, Erin, Bianca

  * make code usable from Python  (involves Cython); see [[http://code.google.com/p/purplesage/issues/detail?id=13|this psage issue]].

  * use code:
 
     - replicate and extend data in Kate's talk
 
     - maybe try genus 2 analogue?

  * possibly implement cubic and sextic residue symbol.    make it really really fast, even if it is implemented, since Kate wants lots of data. 

  * explicit calculation of Grossencharacters. 


== Computing L-series of Jacobians of Certain Hyperelliptic Curves ==

PEOPLE: Jennifer B., Jennifer P., Jennifer J.

  * Decide if curve is attached to a modular form, and if so find it, then use that to compute L-series.

  * Plug L-series into Dokchitser and get numbers.

  * Make a table.  Starting with [[https://www.math.lsu.edu/~wamelen/CMcurves.txt|"van Wamelen"'s table]].  See also [[http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/index.html|Kohel's tables]].

  * Incorporate Robert Bradshaw's code into Purple Sage.  http://code.google.com/p/purplesage/issues/detail?id=14


== Computing in the class group of non-maximal orders of quadratic imaginary fields ==

PEOPLE: William S., Bianca, 

  * Make a list of what you want to be able to do

  * List why Magma/PARI aren't good enough (bugs, issues, speed, etc.)

  * Write really really fast code to implement some of this.
