 * [[http://www.math.washington.edu/Seminars/milliman_0809.php?printer=friendly|The Fields Medalist Andrei Okounkov will speak at UW on May 19, 20, and 21 at 4pm]].   Here's a quote from Okounkov: "This brings up many issues. I am not an expert, but I think we need a symbolic standard to make computer manipulations easier to document and verify. And with all due respect to the free market, perhaps we should not be dependent on commercial software here. An open-source project could, perhaps, find better answers to the obvious problems such as availability, bugs, backward compatibility, platform independence, standard libraries, etc. One can learn from the success of TEX and more specialized software like Macaulay2. I do hope that funding agencies are looking into this."
