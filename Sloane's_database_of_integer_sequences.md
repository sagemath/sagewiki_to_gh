This package provides a local copy of (some of) the sequences found in the [http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/ Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences] (OEIS), also known as "the Sloane database".

Sage has some built-in ability to search the OEIS; see[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/ref/module-sage.databases.sloane.html section 12.5 of the Reference Manual].

For information on installing optional and experimental packages, see[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/ref/module-sage.misc.package.html section 11.2 of the Reference Manual].

TODO: need to make a better distinction between Sage's built-in support for searching the OEIS and what this database provides.
