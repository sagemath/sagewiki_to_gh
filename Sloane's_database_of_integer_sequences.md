This package provides a local copy of (some of) the sequences found in the <a class="http" href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> (OEIS), also known as "the Sloane database". 

See <a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/sloane.html">http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/sloane.html</a> 

Sage has some built-in ability to search the OEIS; see the <a class="http" href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/oeis.html">Reference Manual</a>. 

TODO: need to make a better distinction between Sage's built-in support for searching the OEIS and what this database provides.
