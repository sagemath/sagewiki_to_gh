This package provides a local copy of (some of) the sequences found in the [[http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/|Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] (OEIS), also known as "the Sloane database".

See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/sloane.html

Sage has some built-in ability to search the OEIS; see the [[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/oeis.html|Reference Manual]].

TODO: need to make a better distinction between Sage's built-in support for searching the OEIS and what this database provides.
