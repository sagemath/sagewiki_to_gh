For any nights you're staying in Seattle, there are several good choices in the U District:

 * College Inn: There are shared bathrooms, but I hear the breakfast more than makes up for it.
 * University Inn
 * Travelodge (on 25th St., across from U Village)

== Travel Info ==

The ferry schedule from Anacortes to Lopez is linked [[http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Ferries/Schedule/ScheduleDetail.aspx?tripdate=20090914&departingterm=1&arrivingterm=13&roundtrip=true|here]]. The ferries tend to fill up fast -- make sure to be at Anacortes '''at least''' an hour to an hour and a half early. The WSDOT recommends an hour and a half. On Lopez, it's more like 30 to 60 minutes.

== Local Info ==

[[/localinfo|Here]] is some info about staying and eating on Lopez.
