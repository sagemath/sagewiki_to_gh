At [:days9:Sage Days 9], I gave two talks on using graphics with LaTeX. The slides, in source and PDF format, are available here. PDF of my first talk: attachment:graphics-talk-1.pdf , and LaTeX source (and images) of my first talk: attachment:sd9-talk-1.tar.gz . Those materials are licensed under the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License].

PDF of the second talk: attachment:graphics-talk-2.pdf and source file: attachment:graphics-talk-2.tex .

*CORRECTION!* In the second talk, I claimed that the arXiv does not support TikZ. I am very glad to be wrong about this; you *can* submit papers with TikZ figures to the arXiv -- see [http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0245 arxiv:0708.0245] for an example. They may not have the newest version of PGF/TikZ, though.


'''A note of warning:''' you really need PGF/TikZ version 2.00 to compile the slides from the first talk. Right now, TeXShop doesn't include this, and nor does Ubuntu Hardy. (Intrepid, version 8.10, has the necessary version). I have no idea what the state of affairs is with Windows. To fix this in OS X:

 * download [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/ PGF]
 * extract the package. You get a directory `pgf-2.00`
 * create the directories `~/Library/texmf/tex/generic`
 * move the `pgf-2.00` directory into the `generic` directory you just created.
 * in a terminal, go to the `~/Library/texmf` directory and run "`texhash .`" (note the dot!)
In Ubuntu, it's almost the same thing, but create a directory `/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/generic` and put the PGF package there, just as above, and run "`sudo texhash .`" from the `texmf` directory.

In Windows you are on your own. Free free to edit this page if you know what to do.

This all seems very complicated, and it is because (1) a complete TeX system relies on tens of thousands of files, and (2) the system for finding the right file dates to the 80's. If you'll pardon the massive understatement, it's a bit crufty.

NilsBruin says: There is actually an easy way of putting animations in pdf-presentations created by LaTeX. See the [:days9/PDFLaTeXAnimations:LaTeX animations] page.
