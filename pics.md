 * An animation by Dean Moore: 
Hypotrochoid. Written by Dean Moore, February 2008                            

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/art/hypotrochoid_R_equals_7,_r_equals_2,_d=3.gif

                     Inspiration:                                                                  
                                                                               
 But a SAGE newbie & out to do projects & learn more, one day I was surfing    
 Wikipedia and hit < http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid >, saw          
 the animated graph, and thought, ...                                                                                                                          "I bet I can make SAGE do that."                                                                                                         
 Never one to back from a challenge, I did it.  A few mistakes & wrong turns,  
 at times some strong language & threatening the computer with violence, a few 
 questions to SAGE support groups, but, I finally pounded out code that        
 worked.         
                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 I named it "Hypotrochoid," as animating this was the original inspiration,    
 but the code easily animates other graphs.                         
                           
                                                    
 What this program does:                                                       
                                                                               
 This program animates (not just "draws," but "animates") graphs of several    
 relations, the hypotrochoid, the hypocycloid, the limacon (or "limacon of     
 Pascal"; SAGE doesn't like the French character in the original), the         
 cardioid, the epitrochoid, and the epicycloid.                                
                                                 
                              
 The parametric equations that define a hypotrochoid follow; the parameter     
 is *t*; for hypotrochoid we have R, r, d > 0, R > r > 0:                      
             
{{{                                                                  
 x-coordinate: x = (R - r)*cos(t) + d*cos(((R - r)/r)*t)                       
 y-coordinate: y = (R - r)*sin(t) - d*sin(((R - r)/r)*t)                       
}}}
                                                                            
 For a epitrochoid, the equations are:                                         

{{{                                                                               
 x = (R + r)*cos(t) - d*cos(((R + r)/r)*t)                                                          
 y = (R + r)*sin(t) - d*sin(((R + r)/r)*t)                                     
}}}                                                                            
 The parametric equations are important in computing the period of the         
 relation (below).                                                             
                                                                               
 These parametric equations live all over the Internet; Wikipedia has:

 A few further comments: Some curves of the "roulette" family (see             
 < http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette_%28curve%29 > may be easily           
 animated with this program, as follows:                                       

                                                                                  
 1) The epitrochoid (use the negative of "small" radius *r*, easy, puts        
    rotating circle on the outside.                                            

 2) The hypocycloid, by setting 0 < r < R, d = r.                              

 3) The limacon (or "limacon of Pascal"; SAGE doesn't like the French          
    character in the original), use r < 0, R = abs(r).                         

 4) The epicycloid, use r < 0 (put rotating circle on outside), d = r          

 5) The cardioid, r < 0 d = r                                                  
                                                                                                

To draw different graphs, vary that parameters *R* (fixed circle's radius), *r* 
(rotating circle's radius), and *d* (length of "bar" from rotating circle), 
below; other parameters may be tweaked at will.                      


Of some note, the *epitrochoid* is the "epicycle" curve of Ptolemaic system   
astronomy; one project is to animate some of the Ptolemaic system, but this   
is for the future.

First: I use the same trig functions, over an over again.  Why re-invent the

The next are described by names, but a few notes:

  ** The parameter *fixedCircle* is merely a circle of radius *R* centered at the origin.  
I animated it, as that makes it appear in all frames.  It never moves.

  ** The parameter *rotatingCircle* is more computation-intense.  It's center is on the 
circle at *rDiff* from the edge of the fixed circle; its radius is *r*, and it 
rotates about the fixed circle a total of *circle2PI* times.  Find any internet 
reference on these curves to see it.

  ** The parameter *centerPoints* is solely to make the rotating circle look nicer, 
a clear center.

  ** The parameter *bar* is the "bar" extending from the center of the rotating circle, 
that follows its rotation around the fixed circle.  It always emanates from the 
same center as *fixedCircle*, -- see *fixedCircle* documentation, above -- and its 
terminal point comes from the parametric equation of a hypotrochoid (top).

  ** The parameter *pointAtPen* makes a point where the end of the bar draws the figure, 
of the same color as the final curve.  Note it is at the same point as the terminal point of the "bar."
