 * There is an IRC channel for sage days: #sagemath-days on irc.freenode.net. Feel free to join to discuss whatever...   For those without IRC clients, http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days , but using an IRC client is strongly recommended. [[http://xchat.org/|Xchat]] is a popular cross-platform choice.
