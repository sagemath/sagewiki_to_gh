== Lodging ==

2013/05/29: We had hoped to provide lodging at the Collegiana (more info on this place  on the [[uw-local-info|local information]] page).  However, they are unable to provide us with a block of rooms, so you should make a reservation at an area hotel.  Federal grant money limits reimbursement to 137 dollars a night.  More hotel suggestions are at the [[days48/travel|travel ]] page.

== IRC ==

 * There is an IRC channel for sage days: #sagemath-days on irc.freenode.net. Feel free to join to discuss whatever...   For those without IRC clients, http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days , but using an IRC client is strongly recommended. [[http://xchat.org/|Xchat]] is a popular cross-platform choice.
