'''Sage Number Theory and Development''', <<Anchor(sage_intro)>> ''Alyson Deines'' (10:00-11:00)

This talk will have three parts.  In the first, I will discuss what number theoretic constructs are implemented in Sage and how to use them.  Next, I will compare Sage's functionality with Magma's functionality.  In particular, some gaps in Sage.  The last part is an introduction to Sage development using !GitHub and the Trac server.

'''Overconvergent modular symbols I''', <<Anchor(overconvergent1)>> ''David Roe'' (2:45-3:15)

I will give an introduction to overconvergent modular symbols, their implementation in Sage, and what remains to be done.

'''Variations on Chabauty-Coleman I''', <<Anchor(chabauty1)>> ''Victor Flynn'' (4:30-5:00)

This will be a short introduction to main principles of
using classical Chabauty-Coleman as a technique for finding
rational points on curves, where the rank of the Jacobian
is less than the genus of the curve (note that this will
be an introduction to the main ideas of the technique, and
will not about any specific implementation).

'''Computation of Hida families of ordinary cusp forms''', <<Anchor(hida)>> ''Francesca Bianchi'' (8:00-8:15)

The first example of a $p$-adic family of modular forms goes back to
Serre's construction of the $p$-adic Eisenstein series. At the end of
the 1980s Hida then introduced the notion of a $p$-adic family of
modular forms going through a cuspidal eigenform in the ordinary
subspace of a given weight. This means that we look for a $q$-expansion
such that the coefficients depend $p$-adically on a parameter $k$, in such
a way that specialising the expansion at a certain $k$ gives an
eigenform of weight $k$. In the talk we will present an algorithm to
compute Hida families through an eigenform of trivial character.

'''A family of Eisenstein polynomials generating totally ramified extensions, identification of extensions and construction of class fields''', <<Anchor(eispoly)>> ''Maurizio Monge'' (8:20-8:35)

We present a family of special polynomials generating totally ramified
extensions of local field $K$.  We prove that each extension is generated by at least a
special polynomial, but the number of special polynomials generating
one extension $L$ is at most the number of conjugates of $L/K$ in the
algebraic closure, and in particular it is unique for Galois
extensions. A reduction algorithm is presented, and its study allows
to characterize the set of special polynomials in terms of the
intermediate extensions. A criterion that can ensure that two
polynomials generate non-isomorphic extensions is provided, and
describe an algorithm which allows to construct a totally ramified
class field, given a suitable description of a norm subgroup.

'''Zeta functions of quartic K3 surfaces over F_3''', <<Anchor(K3F3)>> ''Edgar Costa'' (8:40-8:55)

With the goal of doing a census of the Hasse--Weil zeta functions of
quartic K3 surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_3$, we overview the problem of computing the
zeta function of a generic K3 surface over $\mathbb{F}_3$ using $p$-adic methods.

We will give a broad overview of p-adic methods to compute
the zeta function of an algebraic variety.

'''Recent developments and applications of uniform p-adic integration''', <<Anchor(motivic2)>> ''Raf Cluckers'' (11:30-12:30)

As a concrete variant of motivic integration, we will discuss uniform $p$-adic integration and constructive aspects of results involved. Uniformity is in the $p$-adic fields, and, for large primes $p$, in the fields $\mathbb{F}_p((t))$. Using real-valued Haar measures on such fields, one can study integrals, Fourier transforms, etc. We follow a line of research that Jan Denef started in the eighties, with in particular the use of (effective) model theory to study various questions related to $p$-adic integration. A form of uniform $p$-adic quantifier elimination is used, which is algorithmic. Using the notion of definable functions, one builds constructively a class of complex-valued functions which one can integrate (w.r.t. some of the variables) without leaving the class. One can also take Fourier transforms in the class. Recent applications in the Langlands program are based on Transfer Principles for uniform $p$-adic integrals, which allow one to get results for $\mathbb{F}_p((t))$ from results for $\mathbb{Q}_p$, once $p$ is large, and vice versa. These Transfer Principles are obtained via the study of general kinds of loci, some of them being zero loci. More recently, these loci are playing a role in the uniform study of $p$-adic wave front sets for (uniformly definable) $p$-adic distributions, a tool often used in real analysis. This talk contains various joint work with Gordon, Halupczok, Loeser, Raibaut, and some of it is still in progress. Although all the definitions and results are algorithmic, almost nothing has been implemented yet, and questions about optimal complexity are far from being understood, although some lower bounds are known, coming from lower bounds for Presburger arithmetic.

'''Iwasawa theory II''', <<Anchor(iwasawa2)>> ''Chris Wuthrich'' (10:00-11:00)

I intend to show what sage can do with $p$-adic $L$-functions
of elliptic curves. Through the known results on the $p$-adic version of
the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture this gives results on the
Tate-Shafarevich group over $\mathbb{Q}$, even for elliptic curves of rank greater than 1. My
talk should also include what sage cannot do in this direction.

'''Variations on Chabauty-Coleman II''', <<Anchor(chabauty2)>> ''Jennifer Balakrishnan'' (10:00-11:00)

I will discuss the computation of some iterated Coleman integrals that play a role in Kim's nonabelian Chabauty method to find rational points on curves.  In particular, I will give a few examples in the case where the rank of the Jacobian is equal to the genus of the curve where this has been used in joint work with Dogra and Mueller to explicitly find rational points.

'''p-adic Floats''', <<Anchor(precision2)>> ''Xavier Caruso'' (11:30-12:30)


Floating point arithmetic is by far the most common implementation of
real numbers on computers. This is in complete opposition with the
$p$-adic case for which all standard implementations rely on interval
arithmetic.
This talk aims at arguing for initiating -- and then generalizing --
the use of $p$-adic floating point arithmetic in computer algebra systems.
