== Registration ==
Registration will take place on Friday 9 November, at 3.00-5.00pm in Royal Fort House (Dining Room) [see map below] which is adjacent to the maths block. Tea will be served at 4.00pm. Conference packs will also be available for collection on Saturday, in the main maths block.

== Late arrivals ==
If you will be arriving too late for registration on Friday:   for invited participants staying in the Marriott Hotel, you will find an envelope for you at the hotel containing maps and local information, which should be at least enough for you to find the Mathematics Department on Saturday morning.  Allow 15-20 minutes for the (uphill!) walk.

We may plan some informal activities on Friday evening:  watch this space.

See [[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/maps/precinct.html|this map]]: Royal Fort House (& Annexe) is 30; Mathematics (for lectures) is 29; the Marriott Hotel is just to the right of the cathedral, on College Green (see bottom of map).
