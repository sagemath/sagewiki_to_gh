# Languages Design


## GOAL

Using the now almost ready words (next generation) library, it's time to think about a Language category. This library should include the following feature : 

* rationnal languages / automata 
* subshift of finite type / Rauzy graphs 
* language of infinite word (almost done in words) 
* language of a morphism 
* S-adic description of a language (including the particular case of the fixed point of a moprhism) 
* Tree representation (prefixes or suffixes) 
We have to think and be careful with the non empty intersections with : 

* the monoidal category (especially the free one) 
* graphs and trees 
* representation of numbers
