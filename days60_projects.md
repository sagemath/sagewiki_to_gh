= Projects for Sage Days 60 =


== Knot theory ==

Review the existing features in Sage (anything) and elsewhere, and create some tickets of achievable features in the mid-run

== Representation Zeta functions ==

== Expose more features from Symmetrica ==

Amri

#16601

== Rational points on elliptic curves ==

== Play with finite dimensional Hopf algebras ==

Implement a couple, look for dimensions of comodules (by duality)

== Review of tutorials from the Sage-Combinat queue ==
