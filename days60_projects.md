## Tutorials

* Version control with GIT: 2 

* Quick categories intro: 3 

* Overview of Graph theory feature 

* Intro to Algebraic Number Theory 

Here are useful links for Number Theory in Sage: 

      1. <a class="http" href="http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/~kcrisman/mat338/index.html">Here</a> are some lecture notes using Sage on Elementary Number Theory by Karl-Dieter. 
      1. Sage <a class="http" href="http://www.sagemath.org/pdf/en/reference/number_fields/number_fields.pdf">reference manual</a> for number fields.  
      1. <a class="http" href="http://wstein.org/books/ant/ant.pdf">Here</a> is a book by William Stein on Algebraic Number Theory.   
Kn: <a href="days60_projects/Alg_Num_Thy.sws">Here</a> is my Sage Worksheet. This is heavily bases on the references (2) and (3) above.  

* Contributing to Sage

* Explore: polytopes 

* Tutorial: optimized code with Cython 

* Tutorial: commutative algebra 

* Tutorial: Homological algebra 

* Creating sage packages

## Knot theory

Review the existing features in Sage (anything) and elsewhere, and create some tickets of achievable features in the mid-run 

* As we see here, <a href="http://ask.sagemath.org/question/8255/knot-theory-and-sage/">http://ask.sagemath.org/question/8255/knot-theory-and-sage/</a> there is demand for this. 
* Older ideas for many topological things are here <a href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/topology">http://wiki.sagemath.org/topology</a> 
* Here is someone using braid group implementation to do basic knot things <a href="https://quantumtetrahedron.wordpress.com/tag/knot-theory/">https://quantumtetrahedron.wordpress.com/tag/knot-theory/</a> 
* Here is someone who even did some thinking about how to organize it: <a href="https://github.com/amitjamadagni/Knots/wiki/Knot-theory-implementation">https://github.com/amitjamadagni/Knots/wiki/Knot-theory-implementation</a> 
* Here is where braid groups were implemented: <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12339">http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12339</a>
