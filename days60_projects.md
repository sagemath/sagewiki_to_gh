== Tutorials ==

* Version control with GIT: 2

* Quick categories intro: 3

* Overview of Graph theory feature

* Intro to Algebraic Number Theory

Here are useful links for Number Theory in Sage:
 
   1. [[http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/~kcrisman/mat338/index.html|Here]] are some lecture notes using Sage on Elementary Number Theory by Karl-Dieter.
   2. Sage [[http://www.sagemath.org/pdf/en/reference/number_fields/number_fields.pdf| reference manual]] for number fields. 
   3. [[http://wstein.org/books/ant/ant.pdf|Here]] is a book by William Stein on Algebraic Number Theory.

== Knot theory ==

Review the existing features in Sage (anything) and elsewhere, and create some tickets of achievable features in the mid-run

 * As we see here, http://ask.sagemath.org/question/8255/knot-theory-and-sage/ there is demand for this.
 * Older ideas for many topological things are here http://wiki.sagemath.org/topology
 * Here is someone using braid group implementation to do basic knot things https://quantumtetrahedron.wordpress.com/tag/knot-theory/
 * Here is someone who even did some thinking about how to organize it: https://github.com/amitjamadagni/Knots/wiki/Knot-theory-implementation
 * Here is where braid groups were implemented: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12339
