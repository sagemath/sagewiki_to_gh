== Knot theory ==

Review the existing features in Sage (anything) and elsewhere, and create some tickets of achievable features in the mid-run

 * As we see here, http://ask.sagemath.org/question/8255/knot-theory-and-sage/ there is demand for this.
 * Older ideas for many topological things are here http://wiki.sagemath.org/topology
 * Here is someone using braid group implementation to do basic knot things https://quantumtetrahedron.wordpress.com/tag/knot-theory/
 * Here is someone who even did some thinking about how to organize it: https://github.com/amitjamadagni/Knots/wiki/Knot-theory-implementation
 * Here is where braid groups were implemented: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12339
