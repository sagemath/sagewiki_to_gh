== Resources ==

=== Obtaining and Installing Sage ===

    We will standardize on '''Sage Version 4.4''', so please have that version installed on you computer (this is a very new release, and it might be a day or two until the binaries for version 4.4 are available).

    To install Sage, please visit the [[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage website]], click download and follow the instructions. You can either download and install a binary for your system, or you can compile from source. Be aware that compiling from source takes a long time.

=== Guides ===

    '''Sage'''
        * [[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/|Sage tutorial]]
        * [[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/a_tour_of_sage/index.html|A tour of Sage]] closely follows the tour of Mathematica that is at the beginning of the Mathematica Book.
        * [[http://vps.arachnoid.com/sage|Exploring Mathematics with Sage]]: a free, open-source mathematical workshop
        * [[http://www.perrygeo.net/wordpress/?p=116|A quick Cython introduction]]
        * [[http://projecteuler.net/|Project Euler:]] Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. This is a great source of problems to attempt while learning Sage/Python.

    '''Python'''
        * [[http://docs.python.org/tutorial/|Python tutorial]]
        * [[http://www.korokithakis.net/tutorials/python|Learn Python in 10 minutes]] ([[http://mat.oxyg3n.org/index.php?post/2009/07/26/Python-en-10-minutes|disponible en fran√ßais]])
        * [[http://diveintopython.org/|Dive into Python]] is a Python book for experienced programmers. Also available in French, [[http://diveintopython.adrahon.org/|Plongez au coeur de Python]], and [[http://diveintopython.org/#languages|other languages]].
        * [[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/opensource/libraryview.jsp?search_by=Discover+Python+Part|Discover Python]] is a series of articles published in [[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/|IBM's developerWorks]] technical resource center.

    '''Mercurial'''
        * [[http://hginit.com|Hg Init: a Mercurial Tutorial]]. In this user-friendly, six-part tutorial, Joel Spolsky teaches you the key concepts of Mercurial.
        * [[http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide|Learning Mercurial in Workflows]]. This page illustrates the use of Mercurial in various workflows.
        * [[http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqTutorial|Mq Tutorial]]. A tutorial on Mercurial queues.

=== Coding Sprints ===

    There are several proposed topics for coding sprints on the [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki/SageCombinatRoadMap|Sage-Combinat Road Map]]. Others can/will be posted here.
