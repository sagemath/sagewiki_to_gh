[[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage]] Days 74 will take place on May 30 - June 2, 2016 at the [[https://www.obspm.fr/-cias-.html?lang=en|Workshop Center (CIAS)]] of Observatoire de Paris, located in Meudon, near Paris, France.

== Registration ==

Registration is free and now open. Contact Eric (eric.gourgoulhon@obspm.fr) and Travis (tscrimsh@umn.edu) to register.

== Schedule ==

TBA (see the list of speakers below)

== Projects ==

Here is a list of possible projects. Feel free to add your own to the list.

 * [[http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/|SageManifolds]] inclusion into Sage.
 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14901|Lie algebras #14901]] and implement their relationship with manifolds.
 * CW/Cube complexes by generalizing the manifold classes.
 * Computation of geodesics on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
 * Include the `sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds` (i.e. parametrized surfaces) into the more general framework of !SageManifolds.
 * Experiment plotting possibilities with OpenGL (nice stuff from !SnapPy!) and more... what could be supported by a browser?
 * Persistent homology.
 * Simplicial sets. (Co)simplicial objects in various categories.
 * Incorporation of [[https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/ |Kenzo]]?

For a larger choice, see this [[http://lesia.obspm.fr/List-of-some-convenient-hotels.html|list of convenient hotels]] from LESIA/Observatoire de Paris. 

'''NB: since May/June is a high touristic season in Paris, it is recommended to book a room as soon as possible!'''

=== Transportation ===

Meudon is located at 10 min by train from [[http://www.gares-sncf.com/fr/gare/frpmo/paris-montparnasse|Montparnasse station]] in Paris. All hotels listed above are located at a walking distance from Montparnasse station. 
A system of car shuttle will be organized from Meudon station to the Workshop Center (CIAS).

If you plan instead to come by your own, please follow these [[https://www.obspm.fr/acces-au-site-de-meudon.html?lang=en|access instructions]] (click on the map to enlarge it; the CIAS is located in BAT. 9).
