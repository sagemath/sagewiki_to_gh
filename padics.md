= Larger Projects =

These are large projects that will improve the state of p-adics and local rings in Sage.  For each I've tried to estimate the difficulty (which takes into account both the amount of code to be written and any technical challenges I currently forsee), and an opinion on how important the completion of this project is.  Note that some of these projects depend on others; these dependencies can be found on the project pages and are NOT included in the estimated difficulty.

Each project page should eventually contain the following information, though many are still in progress:
 * ''Goal'' -- 1-2 sentence summary of the goal of the project
 * ''Type'' -- The kinds of enhancement that this project represents, e.g. basic features, speed improvements, bug fix, precision handling, conceptual coherence...
 * ''Priority'' -- An estimate of how important the community as a whole considers this project.  There will of course be disagreements about how important different features are.  If you believe that an estimate someone else has made for priority is different from the community average, please bring it up on sage-padics@googlegroups.com rather than just changing it.  If your personal priority is higher than the community average, you should work on that project.  :-)
 * ''Difficulty'' -- A brief estimate on the difficulty of completing this project.  Mainly for people who're looking through the list of projects to determine which they might want to work on.
 * ''Prerequisites'' -- Other projects or tickets that need to be completed before this project (or parts of this project) can be undertaken.
 * ''Background'' -- Background knowledge useful or necessary for working on this project.  This could be mathematical knowledge or familiarity with certain parts of Sage.
 * ''Contributors'' -- People who are interested in working on or discussing this project.
 * ''Progress'' - A brief summary of progress on this project (though this may be hard to keep up to date)
 * ''Related Tickets'' -- Links to related tickets on [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac | Trac]]
 * '''Discussion''' -- A section for design discussion
 * '''Tasks''' -- A breakdown of this project into more manageable pieces.  Ideally, these pieces should be appropriate for an individual patch.  Once implementation has been started on a project, it should be broken down into one or more tickets, and each task should be assigned to a ticket.

= Smaller Projects =

These are smaller projects that are hopefully more accessible to someone new to p-adics in Sage or with less time to devote.  The difficulty range for these projects has been rescaled to account for the fact that they're all shorter than the projects above.
