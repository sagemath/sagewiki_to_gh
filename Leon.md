J.S. Leon's [http://tigger.uic.edu/~jleon/ webpage]

== Goals ==

 * Fix up Leon's code for modern use.

== Progress ==

 * Fixed several issues relating to outdated design.
   * Originally defaulted to using short's: now uses unsigned's.
   * Changed obsolete CLK_TCK to CLOCKS_PER_SEC.
 * Discovered a serious fencepost error in loops.
   * Temporary solution: allocate one more memory spot than necessary to allow Leon's indexing
   * Long term: correct all of Leon's loops to index properly.
 * Discovered undocumented restriction on Cayley library names: no hyphens.

== Solutions to known bugs ==

 1. Related to reading the input file:
   {{{
./wtdist huffman-code4.gap 6 huffman-matrix4 // seems to work, creates huffman-matrix4 file
./desauto -code huffman-code4.gap huffman-matrix4 huffman-autgp4 // does not work

output:
Error: Library block huffman-matrix4 not found in specified library.
Program was executing function read01Matrix (line 234 in file
../../src/leon/src/readdes.c).
}}}
  . Related files:
   * attachment:huffman-code4.gap
  * SOLUTION: Cayley library format does not support names with hyphens. Use only alphanumeric and underscore characters. 

 1. Bus Errors
   {{{
./wtdist example1::left 4 really
Bus error
}}}
  . Related file:
   * attachment:example1 
  * Happens on OS X, but not Linux- it is due to invalid memory access.
  * SOLUTION: see above, regarding "fencepost error."


== Known Bugs in Leon ==

 1. Running out of memory:
   * W. C. Huffman describes a general procedure to produce examples of this bug:
   {{{
The main problem always seems to be when there are only a few minimal weight codewords.  I think you can create a lot of examples that will make it difficult in the following way: Let C1 be any code you want with minimum weight at least 3. Let C2 be the [2,1,2] code with basis [1 1].  Form the direct sum of C1 and C2.  This will create a code of minimum weight 2 with only one codeword of minimum weight 2.  I have a feeling this will give you trouble even if the code C1 has an automorphism group that is easy to compute.
}}}
   * The following codes, as noted by Huffman, commonly cause an out of memory condition. Even if this doesn't happen, they are still good benchmarks for memory use:
