[[http://www.css.washington.edu/room/MEB+238|MEB 238]] will be used for presentations and [[http://www.css.washington.edu/room/MEB+246|MEB 246]] will be used as a workspace.  We also have [[http://www.css.washington.edu/room/MEB+248|MEB 248]], for every day but Tuesday, as overflow or breakout workspace.


== Lodging ==
 * We have a block of rooms reserved at [[http://www.hoteldeca.com/|Hotel Deca]] right at the NW corner of campus and in the heart of the business dostrict close to the University.  Information for making a reservation is:
   * Reservations are to be made by each individual calling the hotel directly at 1.800.899.0251 between the hours of 8a.m. – 7p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. – 4p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, or by faxing reservations to 1.206.545.2103, or emailing requests to reservations@hoteldeca.com.  To guarantee rate and room type, please ensure the name of the group, arrival date, and any other information needed is given at the time of reservation.   
   * Your Group Names is: SAGE Days
   * Your first date of arrival is: 06/16/2014 (this should be 6/15/2014)
   * Your last date of departure is: 06/19/2014
   * Your group rate of \$179.00  is valid for 3 days pre / post contracted dates. (Reimbursment maximum is \$152 on federal grant money.)
   * Your guests have until 05/16/2014 to make reservations for this group.
 * We plan to have some rooms at [[http://www.uwmedicine.org/patient-resources/lodging/collegiana|The Collegianna]], but they cannot confirm those until we are closer to the event.
 * (2014/04/16) More lodging information will be coming soon.

== Mailing Lists ==

 * The mailing list for [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sagedays58|Sage Days 58]],  will be used for Education Days 6 as well.  Please add yourself to this list if you are not already on it.  This will be the primary/only vehicle for announcements before and during the workshop, and last-minute changes during the week.

 * There is also a list specifically for discussing [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu|education and Sage]].

== Participants ==

== Lodging ==

Arrangements for rooms at [[http://www.hoteldeca.com/|Hotel Deca]] have been made.  Please see the [[days48/travel|travel page]] for exact details on reserving a room at a special rate.



== Homework ==
 
 1.  Please complete, by May 31, the pre-event [[https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SageDaysPreWorkshopSurvey2013|survey]], which is part of the grant funding this event.
 1.  Please add a description of projects you plan to work on to the section below.



== IRC ==

 * There is an IRC channel for sage days: #sagemath-days on irc.freenode.net. Feel free to join to discuss whatever...   For those without IRC clients, http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days


== Projects ==

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be:

 * Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course.
 * Preparing worksheets for a course.
 * Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library.
 * Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.

=== Jason Aubrey, Mike Gage, John Travis ===
 * Finishing at least one of the SAGE-WeBWorK bridges; hopefully the one that allows webwork problem authors to include SAGE code in webwork problems for computations and other fun. 

=== Greg Bard ===
 * Making videos suitable for 100-level students to use SAGE in calculus, finite math, statistics, linear algebra, etc... (even precalculus?)

=== Rob Beezer ===
 * Keep workshop organized
 * Document my finitely-generated abelian groups patch [[#9773|http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9773]]
 * Generate a killer worksheet for [[http://cloud.sagemath.org/|Salvus]] from XML source

=== Chris Davis ===
 * Organize and polish the cryptography labs that I used this past year.  A preliminary writeup is [[http://math.uci.edu/~davis/Fall2012Labs.pdf|here]] and preliminary code is [[http://math.uci.edu/~davis/Fall2012Code.sage|here]].
 * Learn how others use Sage in education.  For example, I've seen a Sage Notebook Worksheet that included instructions between the text cells; I did not know this was possible, and would like to learn how to produce such a worksheet myself.

=== Martin Flashman ===
  *Work on a project for visualizing functions using mapping diagrams (aka dynagraphs) for a teaching resource on the subject for beginning algebra through calculus using SAGE.
  *Work with others on how to make these visualizations easy to create making it part of a SAGE toolbox/workspace/workbook.
  *Learn how to embed SAGE in other materials- especially for my on-line calculus book. [[http://users.humboldt.edu/flashman/senscalca_x.html|(The Sensible Calculus Book)]]
  *** If you go to my page for The Sensible Calculus Book you will find how I've added SAGE to this page- with interacts for graphs, direction fields and Euler's Method for DE's as well as one of the mapping diagram interacts I am developing from the assistance of Jeff Denny, Jason Grout, and others. I would like feedback on this if you have suggestions- I have currently hidden the code from the users using the interact buttons. IS it better to show the code?
ALSO- I have a new demo of using Geogebra on the same page to do similar  things with graphs and mapping diagrams dynamically. Is there some way to have Geogebra and SAGE interact?

=== Jim Fowler ===

  * Work on using Sage serverside (instead of my javascript CAS clientside) for the online homework system for [[http://mooculus.osu.edu/|MOOCulus]] as well as in-person calculus courses

=== David Guichard ===
  *Work on material for a combinatorics and graph theory course.

=== Andrey Novoseltsev ===
 * Figure out the best way for public posting of Sage applets like [[http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~novoseltsev/2013Winter215Q1/MI06_three_iterated_integrals_public.html|Three Iterated Integrals]] or [[http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~novoseltsev/2013Winter215Q1/VC01_vector_fields_public.html|Vector Field Plotter]] Meanwhile here are all the applets I made so far: [[attachment:MV-Calculus-Interacts.zip]]
 * Work on issues preventing these applets from working within Sage notebook, e.g. [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14020|#14020 Broken layout]]
 * Figure out the best way for public posting of Sage worksheets using "modules for teaching" like [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14288|#14288 Interactive Simplex Method]]

=== David Perkinson ===
  * Work on a Sage package for hyperplane arrangements.

=== S Singleton ===
 * Develop new worksheets that complement current [[http://www.pogil.org/resources/curriculum-materials| POGIL curriculum materials]]
 * See if a physical chemistry course with "no calculus by hand" is feasible (traditional approaches involving multivariable calculus is problematic for some students).
 * Utilize @interacts for exploratory worksheets.

=== William Stein ===
 * Work on my free open Sage book: http://code.google.com/p/sage-power-book/

=== Karl-Dieter Crisman ===
 * Work on cleaning up HTML and organization etc. for my [[http://www.math.gordon.edu/~kcrisman/mat338|number theory book]]
 * Develop resources for people wanting to make Sage-enabled lecture notes?
 * Review tons of tickets
 * More stuff?

=== Jeff Denny ===
 * Create collection of Sage widgets for teaching calculus
 * Build these into a database similar to the one at http://sagemath.org/eval.html

=== TJ Hitchman ===
 * Work on linear algebra IBL course notes using Sage
 * Make short "intro to cloud.sagemath.com" for students
 * learn about sage development process

=== Glenn Henshaw ===

 * Design interactives for planar lattices corresponding to ideals in quadratic number fields
 * Come up with project ideas, using sage, for a discrete math for IT class
 * Make progress towards a planar lattice class (object) in sage.

=== Barry Balof ===

 * Investigate and build course materials for Combinatorics and Graph Theory, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus Laboratory courses.

We have more travel funding than in the past (airfare and lodging, not food).  If you are involved with Sage, or allied projects, in an educational setting and have a project to work on during the workshop, send a request for funding, with details, to Rob Beezer, beezer@ups.edu.

Anyone with any interest in the use of Sage in educational settings is welcome, and encouraged to attend, with or without funding.
