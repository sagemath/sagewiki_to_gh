== Lodging ==

Arrangements for rooms at [[http://www.hoteldeca.com/|Hotel Deca]] have been made.  Please see the [[days48/travel|travel page]] for exact details on reserving a room at a special rate.



== Homework ==
 
 1.  Please complete, by May 31, the pre-event [[https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SageDaysPreWorkshopSurvey2013|survey]], which is part of the grant funding this event.
 1.  Please add a description of projects you plan to work on to the section below.



== IRC ==

 * There is an IRC channel for sage days: #sagemath-days on irc.freenode.net. Feel free to join to discuss whatever...   For those without IRC clients, http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days


== Projects ==

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be:

 * Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course.
 * Preparing worksheets for a course.
 * Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library.
 * Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.

=== Jason Aubrey, Mike Gage, John Travis ===
 * Finishing at least one of the SAGE-WeBWorK bridges; hopefully the one that allows webwork problem authors to include SAGE code in webwork problems for computations and other fun. 

=== Greg Bard ===
 * Making videos suitable for 100-level students to use SAGE in calculus, finite math, statistics, linear algebra, etc... (even precalculus?)

=== Rob Beezer ===
 * Keep workshop organized
 * Document my finitely-generated abelian groups patch [[#9773|http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9773]]
 * Generate a killer worksheet for [[http://cloud.sagemath.org/|Salvus]] from XML source

=== Chris Davis ===
 * Organize and polish the cryptography labs that I used this past year.  A preliminary writeup is [[http://math.uci.edu/~davis/Fall2012Labs.pdf|here]] and preliminary code is [[http://math.uci.edu/~davis/Fall2012Code.sage|here]].
 * Learn how others use Sage in education.  For example, I've seen a Sage Notebook Worksheet that included instructions between the text cells; I did not know this was possible, and would like to learn how to produce such a worksheet myself.

=== Martin Flashman ===
  *Work on a project for visualizing functions using mapping diagrams (aka dynagraphs) for a teaching resource on the subject for beginning algebra through calculus using SAGE.
  *Work with others on how to make these visualizations easy to create making it part of a SAGE toolbox/workspace/workbook.
  *Learn how to embed SAGE in other materials- especially for my on-line calculus book. [[http://users.humboldt.edu/flashman/senscalca_x.html|(The Sensible Calculus Book)]]
  *** If you go to my page for The Sensible Calculus Book you will find how I've added SAGE to this page- with interacts for graphs, direction fields and Euler's Method for DE's as well as one of the mapping diagram interacts I am developing from the assistance of Jeff Denny, Jason Grout, and others. I would like feedback on this if you have suggestions- I have currently hidden the code from the users using the interact buttons. IS it better to show the code?
ALSO- I have a new demo of using Geogebra on the same page to do similar  things with graphs and mapping diagrams dynamically. Is there some way to have Geogebra and SAGE interact?

=== Jim Fowler ===

  * Work on using Sage serverside (instead of my javascript CAS clientside) for the online homework system for [[http://mooculus.osu.edu/|MOOCulus]] as well as in-person calculus courses

=== David Guichard ===
  *Work on material for a combinatorics and graph theory course.

=== Andrey Novoseltsev ===
 * Figure out the best way for public posting of Sage applets like [[http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~novoseltsev/2013Winter215Q1/MI06_three_iterated_integrals_public.html|Three Iterated Integrals]] or [[http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~novoseltsev/2013Winter215Q1/VC01_vector_fields_public.html|Vector Field Plotter]] Meanwhile here are all the applets I made so far: [[attachment:MV-Calculus-Interacts.zip]]
 * Work on issues preventing these applets from working within Sage notebook, e.g. [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14020|#14020 Broken layout]]
 * Figure out the best way for public posting of Sage worksheets using "modules for teaching" like [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14288|#14288 Interactive Simplex Method]]

=== David Perkinson ===
  * Work on a Sage package for hyperplane arrangements.

=== S Singleton ===
 * Develop new worksheets that complement current [[http://www.pogil.org/resources/curriculum-materials| POGIL curriculum materials]]
 * See if a physical chemistry course with "no calculus by hand" is feasible (traditional approaches involving multivariable calculus is problematic for some students).
 * Utilize @interacts for exploratory worksheets.

=== William Stein ===
 * Work on my free open Sage book: http://code.google.com/p/sage-power-book/

=== Karl-Dieter Crisman ===
 * Work on cleaning up HTML and organization etc. for my [[http://www.math.gordon.edu/~kcrisman/mat338|number theory book]]
 * Develop resources for people wanting to make Sage-enabled lecture notes?
 * Review tons of tickets
 * More stuff?

=== Jeff Denny ===
 * Create collection of Sage widgets for teaching calculus
 * Build these into a database similar to the one at http://sagemath.org/eval.html

=== TJ Hitchman ===
 * Work on linear algebra IBL course notes using Sage
 * Make short "intro to cloud.sagemath.com" for students
 * learn about sage development process

=== Glenn Henshaw ===

 * Design interactives for planar lattices corresponding to ideals in quadratic number fields
 * Come up with project ideas, using sage, for a discrete math for IT class
 * Make progress towards a planar lattice class (object) in sage.

=== Barry Balof ===

 * Investigate and build course materials for Combinatorics and Graph Theory, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus Laboratory courses.

== Funding ==

We have more travel funding than in the past (airfare and lodging, not food).  If you are involved with Sage, or allied projects, in an educational setting and have a project to work on during the workshop, send a request for funding, with details, to Rob Beezer, beezer@ups.edu.

Anyone with any interest in the use of Sage in educational settings is welcome, and encouraged to attend, with or without funding.
