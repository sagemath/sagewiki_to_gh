## Mailing Lists

* The mailing list for <a class="https" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sagedays58">Sage Days 58</a>,  will be used for Education Days 6 as well.  Please add yourself to this list if you are not already on it.  This will be the primary/only vehicle for announcements before and during the workshop, and last-minute changes during the week. 
* There is also a list specifically for discussing <a class="http" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu">education and Sage</a>. 

## Organizers

## Logistics

* At the <a class="http" href="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> Seattle campus (on the west coast of the US, not Washington, DC). 
* This <a href="/uw-local-info">local information page</a> could be helpful but **has not been reviewed** lately for accuracy, so double-check anything critical. 
* The airport code for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is SEA. 
* June 16, 17 and 18 will be full days.  So plan to travel on June 15 and June 19. 
* If you are attending the IBL Conference in Denver, TJ Hitchman suggests Alaska Airlines 860, which departs at 8:25 PM, Wednesday, June 18. 
* All activities will take place in the <a class="http" href="http://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/meb">Mechanical Engineering Building, MEB</a>.  <a class="http" href="http://www.css.washington.edu/room/MEB+238">MEB 238</a> will be used for presentations and <a class="http" href="http://www.css.washington.edu/room/MEB+246">MEB 246</a> will be used as a workspace.  We also have <a class="http" href="http://www.css.washington.edu/room/MEB+248">MEB 248</a>, for every day but Tuesday, as overflow or breakout workspace. 
* <a href="education6/Sage-Edu-Days-6-reimbursement.pdf">Reimbursement Form</a> for participants at Sage Edu Days 6 whose travel was approved in advance for funding.  Please help us by submitting these **as soon as possible,** since our grant ends **very soon.**

## Lodging

Arrangements for rooms at <a class="http" href="http://www.hoteldeca.com/">Hotel Deca</a> have been made.  Please see the <a href="/days48/travel">travel page</a> for exact details on reserving a room at a special rate. 


## Homework

 Please complete, by May 31, the pre-event <a class="https" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SageDaysPreWorkshopSurvey2013">survey</a>, which is part of the grant funding this event. 
 Please add a description of projects you plan to work on to the section below. 

## IRC

There is an IRC channel for sage days: #sagemath-days on irc.freenode.net. Feel free to join to discuss whatever...   For those without IRC clients, <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days">http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days</a> 


## Projects

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be: 
Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course. Preparing worksheets for a course. Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library. Learning how to contribute new code to Sage. 

### Jason Aubrey, Mike Gage, John Travis
Finishing at least one of the SAGE-WeBWorK bridges; hopefully the one that allows webwork problem authors to include SAGE code in webwork problems for computations and other fun.  

### Greg Bard
Making videos suitable for 100-level students to use SAGE in calculus, finite math, statistics, linear algebra, etc... (even precalculus?) 

### Rob Beezer
Keep workshop organized 
Document my finitely-generated abelian groups patch <a href="/education6#A9773">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9773</a> 

Generate a killer worksheet for <a class="http" href="http://cloud.sagemath.org/">Salvus</a> from XML source 


### Chris Davis

Organize and polish the cryptography labs that I used this past year.  A preliminary writeup is <a class="http" href="http://math.uci.edu/~davis/Fall2012Labs.pdf">here</a> and preliminary code is <a class="http" href="http://math.uci.edu/~davis/Fall2012Code.sage">here</a>. 
Learn how others use Sage in education.  For example, I've seen a Sage Notebook Worksheet that included instructions between the text cells; I did not know this was possible, and would like to learn how to produce such a worksheet myself. 

### Martin Flashman
Work on a project for visualizing functions using mapping diagrams (aka dynagraphs) for a teaching resource on the subject for beginning algebra through calculus using SAGE. Work with others on how to make these visualizations easy to create making it part of a SAGE toolbox/workspace/workbook. 
Learn how to embed SAGE in other materials- especially for my on-line calculus book. <a class="http" href="http://users.humboldt.edu/flashman/senscalca_x.html">(The Sensible Calculus Book)</a> 
** If you go to my page for The Sensible Calculus Book you will find how I've added SAGE to this page- with interacts for graphs, direction fields and Euler's Method for DE's as well as one of the mapping diagram interacts I am developing from the assistance of Jeff Denny, Jason Grout, and others. I would like feedback on this if you have suggestions- I have currently hidden the code from the users using the interact buttons. IS it better to show the code? 
ALSO- I have a new demo of using Geogebra on the same page to do similar  things with graphs and mapping diagrams dynamically. Is there some way to have Geogebra and SAGE interact? 


### Jim Fowler

Work on using Sage serverside (instead of my javascript CAS clientside) for the online homework system for <a class="http" href="http://mooculus.osu.edu/">MOOCulus</a> as well as in-person calculus courses 


### David Guichard
Work on material for a combinatorics and graph theory course. 

### Andrey Novoseltsev

Figure out the best way for public posting of Sage applets like <a class="http" href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~novoseltsev/2013Winter215Q1/MI06_three_iterated_integrals_public.html">Three Iterated Integrals</a> or <a class="http" href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~novoseltsev/2013Winter215Q1/VC01_vector_fields_public.html">Vector Field Plotter</a> Meanwhile here are all the applets I made so far: <a href="education6/MV-Calculus-Interacts.zip">MV-Calculus-Interacts.zip</a> 

Work on issues preventing these applets from working within Sage notebook, e.g. <a class="http" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14020">#14020 Broken layout</a> 

Figure out the best way for public posting of Sage worksheets using "modules for teaching" like <a class="http" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14288">#14288 Interactive Simplex Method</a> 


### David Perkinson
Work on a Sage package for hyperplane arrangements. 

### S Singleton

Develop new worksheets that complement current <a class="http" href="http://www.pogil.org/resources/curriculum-materials">POGIL curriculum materials</a> 
See if a physical chemistry course with "no calculus by hand" is feasible (traditional approaches involving multivariable calculus is problematic for some students). Utilize @interacts for exploratory worksheets. 

### William Stein

Work on my free open Sage book: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sage-power-book/">http://code.google.com/p/sage-power-book/</a> 


### Karl-Dieter Crisman

Work on cleaning up HTML and organization etc. for my <a class="http" href="http://www.math.gordon.edu/~kcrisman/mat338">number theory book</a> 
Develop resources for people wanting to make Sage-enabled lecture notes? Review tons of tickets More stuff? 

### Jeff Denny
Create collection of Sage widgets for teaching calculus 
Build these into a database similar to the one at <a href="http://sagemath.org/eval.html">http://sagemath.org/eval.html</a> 


### TJ Hitchman
Work on linear algebra IBL course notes using Sage Make short "intro to cloud.sagemath.com" for students learn about sage development process 

### Glenn Henshaw
Design interactives for planar lattices corresponding to ideals in quadratic number fields Come up with project ideas, using sage, for a discrete math for IT class Make progress towards a planar lattice class (object) in sage. 

### Barry Balof
Investigate and build course materials for Combinatorics and Graph Theory, Multivariable Calculus, and Calculus Laboratory courses.

## Funding

We have more travel funding than in the past (airfare and lodging, not food).  If you are involved with Sage, or allied projects, in an educational setting and have a project to work on during the workshop, send a request for funding, with details, to Rob Beezer, <a href="mailto:beezer@ups.edu">beezer@ups.edu</a>. 

Anyone with any interest in the use of Sage in educational settings is welcome, and encouraged to attend, with or without funding.
