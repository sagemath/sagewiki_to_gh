== Iwaniec-Luo-Sarnak ==

 * chair: Kaneenika Sinha
 * times: Wednesdays 11-12.  Please note: The first meeting on 19 Jan will be from 2-3 pm in the Baker boardroom.
 * Wed. 19 Jan in the Common Room: Henryk Iwaniec, ''Introduction to low lying zeros of L-functions'' 
    
   Abstract: The content of the paper "Low lying zeros of families of L-functions" by Iwaniec, Luo and Sarnak will be described in general terms.

 * H. Iwaniec, W. Luo, and, P. Sarnak, Low lying zeros of families of L-functions, Publ. IHES, 2000.
    [[attachment:Iwaniec-Luo-Sarnak.pdf]]
 * there is also a study guide and reading list by Steven Miller, at Williams: http://www.williams.edu/go/math/sjmiller/public_html/ntandrmt/

== Bhargava-Shankar ==

 * chair: Barry Mazur
 * times: Thursdays 11-12
 * next meeting will be 2-3pm (Simons auditorium), Tuesday 25 January - Melanie Wood, who recommends reading http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0672 (only for the proofs of the main terms). "Section 1-5,8 of that paper I think are a very good introduction to the ideas in a case small enough to actually picture."
 * pp. 2-9 (i.e., the Introduction) of Binary quadratic forms having bounded invariants, and the boundedness of average ranks of elliptic curves
 * Manjul's collected works: http://wstein.org/home/wstein/travel/2011/msri/bhargava/

== General question group ==

 * (e.g., average ap ’s, Sato-Tate (the statement), etc.) Not yet scheduled.
