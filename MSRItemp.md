== Cohen-Lenstra heuristics ==

 * chair: Bjorn Poonen
 * The first meeting of the reading group will be Tuesday, January 25, 11-12. (Bjorn will be away the preceding week.) It will be in the 2nd floor seminar room if that room is available.
 * Informal reading group on the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics
 * Reading list (in increasing order of sophistication):

   * MR0750661 Cohen, H. ; Lenstra, H. W., Jr.  Heuristics on class groups. Number theory (New York, 1982), 26--36, Lecture Notes in Math., 1052, Springer, Berlin, 1984.

   * MR0756082 (85j:11144) Cohen, H. ; Lenstra, H. W., Jr.  Heuristics on class groups of number fields.  Number theory, Noordwijkerhout 1983 (Noordwijkerhout, 1983), 33--62, Lecture Notes in Math., 1068, Springer, Berlin, 1984.

   * MR1837670 (2003a:11065) Delaunay, Christophe.  Heuristics on Tate-Shafarevitch groups of elliptic curves defined over Q. Experiment. Math. 10 (2001), no. 2, 191--196.

   * PDFs of these three papers have been placed in my public directory at MSRI, which I think can be accessed by typing `cd ~bpoonen/Public` at a terminal prompt.

== Iwaniec-Luo-Sarnak ==

 * chair: Kaneenika Sinha
 * times: Wednesdays 11-12.  Please note: The first meeting on 19 Jan will be from 2-3 pm in the Baker boardroom.
 * Wed. 19 Jan in the Common Room: Henryk Iwaniec, ''Introduction to low lying zeros of L-functions'' 
    
   Abstract: The content of the paper "Low lying zeros of families of L-functions" by Iwaniec, Luo and Sarnak will be described in general terms.

 * H. Iwaniec, W. Luo, and, P. Sarnak, Low lying zeros of families of L-functions, Publ. IHES, 2000.
