Informal reading group on the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics

Reading list (in increasing order of sophistication):

MR0750661 Cohen, H. ; Lenstra, H. W., Jr.  Heuristics on class groups.
Number theory (New York, 1982), 26--36, Lecture Notes in Math., 1052,
Springer, Berlin, 1984.

MR0756082 (85j:11144) Cohen, H. ; Lenstra, H. W., Jr.  Heuristics on
class groups of number fields.  Number theory, Noordwijkerhout 1983
(Noordwijkerhout, 1983), 33--62, Lecture Notes in Math., 1068,
Springer, Berlin, 1984.

MR1837670 (2003a:11065) Delaunay, Christophe.  Heuristics on
Tate-Shafarevitch groups of elliptic curves defined over Q.
Experiment. Math. 10 (2001), no. 2, 191--196.


PDFs of these three papers have been placed in my public directory at MSRI,
which I think can be accessed by typing
   cd ~bpoonen/Public
at a terminal prompt.

The first meeting of the reading group will be Tuesday, January 18, 11-12.
It will be in the 2nd floor seminar room if that room is available.

Best,
Bjorn Poonen
