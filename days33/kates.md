* [[attachment:KateWishList.sws]]
  * Wrap E.reduction(prime)(P) so that we can also use P.reduction(prime)
  * See what exactly is going on in E.global_minimal_model(), is it returning the unique restricted model?  If so, update documentation
  * Implement Singular Weierstrass Equations and functionality similar to Elliptic Curves
     * make E.reduction(bad_prime) able to return this singular cubic object (maybe with a flag?)
     * change weierstrass model, addition of points, P.is_singular() to check if point is node/cusp, etc
  * Compute lots of examples to find guesses for bounds on "C"
  * p-adic Tate's algorithm

* Put Kate's EDS class into sage (document properly)?
