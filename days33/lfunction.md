=== Project Description ===

For L-series lovers:  Getting the doctest coverage to 100% on this
might be a good project:

  http://code.google.com/p/purplesage/source/browse/psage/lseries/eulerprod.py

That may discover "issues" (bugs), which I would likely have to fix,
but would also be fun because one gets to come up with lots of
creative examples of L-series all over the place.   Also, the top of
that file has a todo list for new features to implement -- most would
be bad projects, but one which would be good would be to make it so
the Lseries object can use Lcalc (Rubinstein's program) to compute
L-series instead of Dokchitser.  This would be a good project, because
it would mainly involve thinking about the annoying mathematics
involved in going between normalizing L-series with the center of the
critical strip at 1/2 versus not doing that.  Also, it is all pure
Python, so easier to get going.

Anyway, I'd say 1 could be a good project for people who know the
basics of L-series, but want to get a much more concrete feel for
them.  In fact, instead of just trying to get coverage to 100%,
writing a *tutorial* for computing with L-series using that package
would be really nice.   E.g., one could walk through how to find
missing information, create new L-series classes, etc.
