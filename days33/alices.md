* from Alice's talk:
  * Implement the algorithm (use Sage's pseudoprime function to check)
  * What other primality tests does Pari have? Wrap these.
  * Make things faster: implement as a python (maybe cython??) file
  * How does GIMPS work?
  * Ask Drew Sutherland what he's done?
  * Implement Larry Washington's formulas for dealing with elliptic curves over integral domains
