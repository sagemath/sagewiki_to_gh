= Sage Days 114 =

Following the [[http://math.iisc.ac.in/fpsac2022/|34th FPSAC 2022]].

The Sage days will consist in an intense three-day meeting at IMSc:

 * July 25–27, 2022, [[https://www.imsc.res.in|The Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc)]], Chennai, India

Following this intense period, a working group on
software for mathematics and their illustration
will meet twice a week for a few weeks, mostly at
the Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI), led
by Julian Rüth and Samuel Lelièvre.

== Sage Club at CMI ==

Following the Sage Days, a *Sage Club* will meet twice a week at CMI. The *Sage Club* is going to be an open forum, led by Samuel Lelièvre and Julian Rüth, where we will learn more about SageMath, focusing on the interests of the participants. Just as with the Sage Days, beginners and students are very welcome at any session.

We will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3pm, starting from Thursday 28th of July. (If this time frame is inconvenient for you, please let us know, we should be able to move the sessions to another time.)

The exact location at CMI where we will meet has not been fixed yet. It will be announced here.

There is no precise program for the *Sage Club*. We will certainly begin with tutorials to get you started but after that we want to adapt to the interests of the participants. To give you some ideas, we could try to see how Sage can be used to solve a problem that you are working on, we could look into visualization of Mathematics, we could try to extend some part of SageMath, we could discuss mathematical problems with a computational flavor, …
