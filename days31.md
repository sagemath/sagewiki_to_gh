== Mailing List ==

 * Mailing list for [[http://groups.google.com/group/sagedays31|Sage Days 31]].  Please add yourself to this list if you are not already on it.  This will be the primary vehicle for announcements, and last-minute changes during the week.

== IRC ==

 * There is an IRC channel for sage days: #sagemath-days on irc.freenode.net. Feel free to join to discuss whatever...   For those without IRC clients, http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days , but using an IRC client is strongly recommended. [[http://xchat.org/|Xchat]] is a popular cross-platform choice.

== Funding ==

 If you're interested in attending, there may be funding for you.   Email wstein@gmail.com. 

 '''Be sure to buy your plane ticket on a US carrier.'''

== Logistics ==

 * [[education3|Sage Education Days 3]] will happen at the end of the week, June 16-18, 2011.
 * Lodging will likely be arranged for the participants at the Collegiana Inn near the UW campus.  Details later.
 * See the [[uw-local-info|local information page]] for more specifics.

== Flask Notebook Development ==

  * Rado's leading edge repo:  [[http://code.google.com/r/rkirov-flask/]]
  * Find instructions at Rado's site for Linux, Mac OSX installation
  * Main, official repo: [[http://code.google.com/p/sagenb/]]
  * Development model:  Jason Grout, Rado Kirov, William Stein will pull from repos; a couple of options on how to create and use your own repo:
    1. Host your repo on Google Code by [[https://code.google.com/r/rkirov-flask/source/createClone|server-side cloning Rado's repo]] and then cloning your serverside clone ("yourname-sagenb" or something) to your computer (follow the directions on Google Code). Your repository can be pulled from in the standard way, but can only be pushed to by you (you can pull changes from other people and then push them, of course).
    1. Host your repo on sage.math or somewhere else by cloning Rado's repo (do `hg clone https://rkirov-flask.googlecode.com/hg/` somewhere). If you set appropriate read/write permissions on your repo, then people can push to and pull from your repo using the `ssh://` URI scheme (for example `hg pull ssh://sage.math.washington.edu//home/keshav/some_repo/` -- note the double slash, to use an absolute path rather than a relative patch).

    * flask_version - new flask controller code
          o authentication.py
          o base.py
          o ...

          o user.py
          o notebook.py
          o ...
    * sagenb/storage - serialization to filesystem code
          o abstract_storage.py
          o filesystem_storage.py
    * sagenb/data - templates and js libraries
          o sage/js - javascript and sage/html - templates
          o jmol
          o jsmath
    * notebook folder with worksheets and settings is by default in ~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/
