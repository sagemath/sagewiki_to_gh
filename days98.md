= Sage Days 98 : Women in sage (2019) =

'''''April 8 - 12, 2019'''''
'''''Archanes, Crete'''''

<<TableOfContents()>>

These Sage days are a special event for women* who develop in [[http://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]] or wish to learn Sage. They will include introduction presentations, training,  and team work on
specific projects. There is no initial knowledge needed, everyone is welcome whether they are new Sage learners or Sage expert. We believe in diversity in backgrounds and experiences.

This event is fully funded by the [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]] project.

*This event is primarily targeted at women as to help form a team of women developers and to reduce the gap between men and women developers in Sage Math in particular and in open scientific software in general. It is for all women (trans welcome).

== Venue ==

'''Local cost (lodging and food) will be provided for all participants'''

The workshop will take place in the village of Archanes in Crete. We will share different lodgings in rented apartments.

== The event ==

The event will be workshop style and most of the schedule will be decided by the participants as needed.

We will start the week by some introduction presentations and tutorials especially targeted at those who don't know much Sage. Then each participant will have an occasion to present their mathematical and / or Sage project to the group. Most of week will be dedicated to coding either individually or in groups. We will plan other presentations and tutorials depending on the needs and wishes of the participants.

== Application ==

Due to the conditions of the workshop, the size of the event is limited. We ask every potential participant to send an application. '''Applications are due Feb 28''', a response will be sent in early March or even earlier if the number of applications is limited.

'''Previous programming experience:''' describe your programming experience either with Sage or any other language. Please note '''that previous
experience is not necessary''' to participate to the event!

'''Mathematical / Sage project:''' If you have a specific project in mind to work on during the week, please describe it. Otherwise, tell us what part
of Sage you are interested in and what kind of mathematics you do.

'''Motivation:''' please explain what motivates you to participate to this event.

'''reference letter:''' if you are a student, please attach a reference letter.

'''Funding request''' Do need travel funding to attend the event? (Note that local expenses are covered for all participants)
