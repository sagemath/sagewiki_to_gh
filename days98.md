'''''April 8 - 12, 2019'''''
'''''Archanes, Crete'''''

<<TableOfContents()>>

These Sage days are a special event for women* who develop in [[http://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]] or wish to learn Sage. They will include introduction presentations, training,  and team work on
specific projects.

This event is fully funded by the [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]] project.

*This event is primarily targeted at women as to help form a team of women developers and to reduce the gap between men and women developers in Sage Math in particular and in open scientific software in general. It is for all women (trans welcome).
