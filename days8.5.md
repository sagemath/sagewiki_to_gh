== Dates you could come ==

 * William Stein: any dates during June 13 - June 22, July 3 - July 6.... (I'm now going to ISSAC July 20-23 too). 
 * Michael Abshoff: pretty much any date except July 20–23, i.e. ISSAC 2008
 * Martin Albrecht: most dates should be fine after June 14 until August 17 (CRYPTO)
 * Marshall Hampton: Only great dates for me are July 13 - 18th; my summer is very tightly scheduled.  I will try to make any weekend date.
 * Craig Citro: Anything after July 4 works great for me. 
 * Jason Grout: May 19 - May 23; June 23 - June 26; July 28 - Aug 15
 * David Roe: May 24-June 25, August 18-Sept 9
 * Emily Kirkman: June 13 - June 22
 * Clément Pernet: any date except July 7-11 (SIAM meeting in San Diego), and maybe July 20-23 (ISSAC), although not sure I'll go there.
 * Mike Hansen: any dates at this point
 * Burcin Erocal: 
 * David Harvey
 * Bill Purvis: any dates at this point (retired systems engineer)

== Topics ==

  * Cython -- something much deeper than usual, and not necessarily so Sage related.  Cython is one of the "killer apps" of Sage:
     * expand range of Cython developers (i.e., Robert tells us how to work on Cython). 
     * increase documentation
     * future development directions
     * PEX
     * pickling 

  * MS Windows -- figure out how to do a full native port of Sage to Windows. Seattle would be a good place for this theme, and I'm working on getting some Microsoft funding to support doing a port.
     * visiting Microsoft and meeting the clients
     * finish the cygwin part
     * teach everyone how to use MSVC


  * Parallel computation in Sage -- DSage, Ipython1, Threads again; sort of like the MSRI conference last year but much more focused on Sage and actual implementations.
   

  * Exact linear algebra -- perfect to capitalize on Clement Pernet being around, and the positive momentum behind Linbox, IML, etc.  There would be a number of talks on all the basic tricks of exact linear algebra, systematic benchmarking, with the goal being to "beat Magma" at a range of exact linear algebra problems.
