The following program is preliminary.

=== Program: ===

   * October 10: Linear Algebra (chair Clement Pernet)
     Invited speakers:
       * [http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/ Arne Storjohann]
       * [http://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Jean-Guillaume.Dumas/ Jean-Guillaume Dumas]:[:/JGDumasTalk: Simultaneous Modular Reduction and Kronecker Substitution for Small Finite Fields]
     Contributing speakers:
       * Martin Albrecht: [:/MAlbrechtTalk: Matrix multiplication over GF(2) and the M4RI library]
       * Gregory Bard
       * [http://www.rlmiller.org Robert Miller]: [:/RMillerTalk: An example of implementing automorphism groups: linear codes]
   * October 11: Elliptic Curves (chair Laurent Fousse)
     Invited speakers:
       * [http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ John Cremona]: Elliptic Curves in Sage
       * [http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/david.lubicz/index_en.html David Lubicz]: [:/DavidLubiczTalk: Computing modular correspondences for abelian varieties (with Jean-Charles Faugère)]
     Contributing speakers:
       * Nadia El Mrabet: [:/NadiaElMrabetTalk: Implementing the Weil, Tate and Ate pairings using SAGE]
   * October 12: Groebner Bases (chair Ludovic Perret)
     Invited speakers:
       * Carlo Traverso: [:/CarloTraversoTalk: Groebner bases, lattices and cryptography]
       * [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~eschost/ Éric Schost]: Computing with triangular families of polynomials: an overview
     Contributing speakers:
       * B.  Erocal : SCrypt: Using Symbolic Computation to Bridge the Gap Between Algebra and Cryptography
       * M. Brickenstein : Secrets of Singular and PolyBoRi
         This talk presents techniques for Gröbner bases calculations
         implemented in the computer algebra system Singular and the
         PolyBoRi framework. I will consider
          * data structures
          * algorithms
         and give application examples, show their structure and explain how
         to exploit it.
       * [http://www-calfor.lip6.fr/~renault/index.html G. Renault]
   * October 13-15: Coding Sprints (chair Michael Abshoff)

Each "talk" day (October 10 to 12) typically has 2 invited speakers, who are
specialists in the corresponding domain, not necessarily already in contact
with SAGE, and 3 contributed speakers, who typically describe a SAGE module
(or a proposal of).

The SAGE Days 10 dinner will take place on the 11th.
