   * October 10: Linear Algebra (chair Clement Pernet)
     Invited speakers:
       * [http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/ Arne Storjohann]:[:/AStorjohannTalk: Algorithms for linear algebra on polynomial and integer matrices: similarities and differences]
       * [http://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Jean-Guillaume.Dumas/ Jean-Guillaume Dumas]:[:/JGDumasTalk: Simultaneous Modular Reduction and Kronecker Substitution for Small Finite Fields]
     Contributing speakers:
       * Martin Albrecht: [:/MAlbrechtTalk: Matrix multiplication over GF(2) in the M4RI library]
       * Gregory Bard : Using Graph Theory to Control Fill-in for Sparse Matrix Reduction to RREF over Fields of non-zero characteristic
       * [http://www.rlmiller.org Robert Miller]: [:/RMillerTalk: An example of implementing automorphism groups: linear codes]
   * October 11: Elliptic Curves (chair Laurent Fousse)
     Invited speakers:
       * [http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ John Cremona]: Elliptic Curves in Sage
         This talk will give a survey of Sage's capabilities for computations with
         elliptic curves, including some recent developments and a wish-list of
	 possible future developments.
       * [http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/david.lubicz/index_en.html David Lubicz]: [:/DavidLubiczTalk: Computing modular correspondences for abelian varieties (with Jean-Charles Faugère)]
     Contributing speakers:
       * Nadia El Mrabet: [:/NadiaElMrabetTalk: Implementing the Weil, Tate and Ate pairings using Sage]     
   * October 11: Sage-Combinat (chair Nicolas Thiery) (follows the Elliptic Curves session)
       The purpose of the *-Combinat project is to provide an extensible
       toolbox for computer exploration in algebraic combinatorics, and
       foster code sharing between researchers in this area. We will present
       the history, features, and design of MuPAD-Combinat, and discuss the
       timeline, difficulties, but also great technical and community
       opportunities that arise from the ongoing port as Sage-Combinat.
     Invited Speakers:
       * Florent Hivert and Nicolas Thiéry: *-Combinat: Sharing Algebraic Combinatorics since 2000
     Contribution speakers:
       * Mike Hansen: Decomposable Objects and combinatorial species
       * Robert Miller: Partition Refinement for Classification
       * Franco Saliola: Posets and words in Sage-Combinat
   * October 12: Groebner Bases (chair Ludovic Perret)
     Invited speakers:
       * Carlo Traverso: [:/CarloTraversoTalk: Groebner bases, lattices and cryptography]
       * [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~eschost/ Éric Schost]: [:/EricSchostTalk: Computing with triangular families of polynomials: an overview]
     Contributing speakers:
       * B.  Erocal : [:/BurcinErocalTalk: SCrypt: Symbolic computation assists algebraic cryptanalysis]
       * M. Brickenstein : Secrets of Singular and PolyBoRi
         This talk presents techniques for Gröbner bases calculations
         implemented in the computer algebra system Singular and the
         PolyBoRi framework. I will consider
          * data structures
          * algorithms
         and give application examples, show their structure and explain how
         to exploit it.
       * [http://www-calfor.lip6.fr/~renault/index.html Guénaël Renault]: [:/GuenaelRenaultTalk: Computation of the Triangular Representation of a Splitting Field]
   * October 13-15: Coding Sprints (chair Michael Abshoff)
   * October 14: SAGE Demo by Robert Bradshaw at 17h.
