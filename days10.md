     The Elliptic Curves session will be followed by the SAGE-combinat session, starting at 15h30.
   * October 12: Groebner Bases (chair Ludovic Perret)
     Invited speakers:
       * Carlo Traverso: [:/CarloTraversoTalk: Groebner bases, lattices and cryptography]

         This talk presents techniques for Gröbner bases calculations
         implemented in the computer algebra system Singular and the
         PolyBoRi framework. I will consider
          * data structures
          * algorithms
         and give application examples, show their structure and explain how
         to exploit it.
