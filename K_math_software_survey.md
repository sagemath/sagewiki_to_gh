This is a survey of requirements for kindergarten math education by state and survey of math software for use in kindergarten classes. Base google search was: '''[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Kindergarten+math+math+software+software&btnG=Search kindergarten math math software software]'''. A good overview of educational software in general is a [http://wikipedia.org Wikipedia] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_software article] on the subject. This wiki page is the first step in a project for possible full K-math support in SAGE. The project is being undertaken by timothy.clemans@gmail.com under the supervision of wstein@gmail.com.

This is the current stage of the project:
"The next thing you should do (when you have time), is for each software
that you can get a demo of, you should try it out and think about:
{{{
 (1) is it good or bad quality?
 (2) is there something that it does that is creative, useful, etc?
 (3) is there something the software does that would make sense
     to do in the context of SAGE?
 (4) anything else you can think of.
}}}
And make sure to record all your ideas regarding 1-4 for each program
you try it.", wstein, Feb 22, 2007 11:13 PM
