Note: Travis Scrimshaw would be happy to join brainstorms remotely:
''I fly on Wednesday afternoon (Minneapolis time) and arrive Thursday
afternoon (Germany time), but I am basically free all day Tuesday (and
I wake up early). Thursday or Friday works too from Berlin''

Fran√ßois Bissey from sage-on-gentoo: I would be happy to join some brainstorming session remotely from New Zealand. At the time of the meeting I will be 11 hours ahead if I am not mistaken. 9am for you will be 8pm for me, and 8pm for you will be 7am the next day for me. So I may able to connect during your morning for a little bit and if you have late (10pm+) sessions.

=== SageMath Live ===

  * SageDebianLive
  * [[https://launchpad.net/~aims/+archive/ubuntu/aims-desktop|AIMS Desktop]] is an installer and LiveISO which includes Sagemath. Should soon be available as a public ISO. Will either recompile all Ubuntu binaries in order to be allowed to redistribute, or rebase on Debian.

=== Modularization ===

  * Make Sage more modular, using pip packages.
    * Make interrupt.pyx a stand-alone package: [[https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals]] and [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20002|Trac #20002]]
    * Make the Sage <-> PARI interface a stand-alone package: [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20238|Trac #20238]]
