= Packaging and distributing SageMath =

'''''a Sage days 77 project'''''

Part of the [[days77|days 77]] workshop was dedicated to studying possible improvements to SageMath's package system and availability in popular distributions.

There is a cyclic interest in these issues. Past Sage Days that have also dealt with them were [[days4/projects/packaging|days 4]] and [[days7/DebianPackagingSprint|days 7]].

When talking about ''modularization'', ''packaging'', ''distribution'', etc., Sage devs may mean several different things at the same time:

 * Distributing SageMath as a set of packages for a popular distribution (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Anaconda, ...);
 * Improving the current module system builtin in SageMath (at the time of writing, SPKGs), and its interfaces with the build system and the development workflow;
 * Splitting the SageMath library into more modules, possibly making some modules optional;
 * Taking components out of SageMath and making them available to general purpose python code (e.g., via pip);
