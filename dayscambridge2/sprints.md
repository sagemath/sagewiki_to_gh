== Compute regulators of elliptic curves over function fields ==

== Is there an algorithm to enumerate all elliptic curves over a function field of a given conductor? ==

== Implement Tate's algorithm for elliptic curves over the function field $\mathbf{F}_p(t)$. ==

== Implement computation of the 3-Selmer rank of an elliptic curve over $\mathbf{Q}$. ==

== Compute statistics about distribution of Heegner divisors and Kolyvagin divisors modulo primes $p$. ==

== Create a table of images of Galois representations, for elliptic curves and/or Jacobians, in some range. ==

== Fully implement and optimize variant of Watkins's algorithm for fast computation of Heegner points. ==

== Implement code to compute the asymptotic distribution of Kolyvagin classes (from Jared Weinstein's talk); this should be pretty easy, though generalizing to higher rank may be challenging. ==

== Verify Kolyvagin's conjecture for a specific rank 3 curve. ==

== Implement an algorithm in Sage to compute Stark-Heegner points. ==

== Compute the higher Heegner point $y_5$ on the curve 389a '''provably correctly'''.  ==

== Compute special values of the Gross-Zagier $L$-function $L(f,\chi,s)$.  ==

== Implement something toward the Pollack et al. overconvergent modular symbols algorithm. ==

== Compute a Heegner point on the Jacobian of a genus 2 curve ==
