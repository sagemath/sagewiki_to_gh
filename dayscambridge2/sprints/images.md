Hi William,

I would definitely be motivated to work on the table of Galois images project that you suggested in your list. I am currently rerunning my previous computations on the Stein-Watkins database using an improved version of the algorithm (just for the mod ell case at the moment, I still want to tweak the mod ell^k code some more). It would be great to get all this data organized and accessible in a useful form, especially while everything is fresh in my mind.
