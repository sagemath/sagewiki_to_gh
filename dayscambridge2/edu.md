== Fix Cayley Tables of Groups ==

People: ''Rob Beezer''

Cayley tables are broken for groups (its in Trac - Jason discovered the problem), seemingly far too complicated with calls to GAP, and it produces symbolic matrices (overkill?).  See http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7340

I have working code for what I will probably call "operation tables."  General enough they could be used for both addition and multiplication tables of a ring.  Unfinished code is posted on Trac and maybe somebody would want to help/advise on what might be desired as I try to do this right.  It'd motivate me to finish it.  http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7555

So this is definitely a project that has education as its audience.  

Maybe Karl-Dieter has some symbolic/calculus/maxima projects that are worth tackling quickly?
