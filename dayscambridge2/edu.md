== Fix Cayley Tables of Groups ==

People: ''Rob Beezer''

Cayley tables are broken for groups (its in Trac - Jason discovered the problem), seemingly far too complicated with calls to GAP, and it produces symbolic matrices (overkill?).

I have working code for what I will probably call "operation tables."  General enough they could be used for both addition and multiplication tables of a ring.  So I will post unfinished code on Trac and maybe somebody would want to help/advise on what might be desired as I try to do this right.  It'd motivate me to finish it.

So this is definitely a project that has education as its audience.  If you instead had something in mind that wasn't so much about coding, holler - otherwise sometime today I'll post a description on the wiki and make a ticket.

Maybe Karl-Dieter has some symbolic/calculus/maxima projects that are worth tackling quickly?
