## Fix Cayley Tables of Groups

People: _Rob Beezer_ 

Cayley tables are broken for groups (its in Trac - Jason discovered the problem), seemingly far too complicated with calls to GAP, and it produces symbolic matrices (overkill?).  See <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7340">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7340</a> 

I have working code for what I will probably call "operation tables."  General enough they could be used for both addition and multiplication tables of a ring.  Unfinished code is posted on Trac and maybe somebody would want to help/advise on what might be desired as I try to do this right.  It'd motivate me to finish it.  <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7555">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7555</a> 

So this is definitely a project that has education as its audience.   

Maybe Karl-Dieter has some symbolic/calculus/maxima projects that are worth tackling quickly?
