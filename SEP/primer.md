 * check text part of worksheets into {{{$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/primer/}}}
 * quadratic forms primer would be in  {{{$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/primer/quadratic_forms}}}
 * notebook help screen would offer button to inject any primer from {{{$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/primer/}}} into currently running notebook
