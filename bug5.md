= SAGE Bug Squash Day 5 =
The event will take place on '''SATURDAY, November 3rd''' and officially start at 10 am pacific standard time. It will "officially" go nonstop for 10 hours (until 8pm) and some people will usually meet the day after and finish up some of the leftovers.

Remember the "Twisted Rule" -- Don't work on '''anything''' unless there is a trac ticket for it.

 * [:bug5/status:STATUS]
 * [:bug5/irc:IRC log]
 * ["/Results"]
 * The base version of SAGE we'll start will probably be 2.8.11.

There is a prebuilt version on sagemath.org here, which you'll need to hg_sage.pull() on as above:

 * The trac server with all the bugs is here:
  . http://trac.sagemath.org
 * Write to wstein@gmail.com for an account on the bug tracker.
 * We'll all be on #sage-devel at irc.freenode.net.
