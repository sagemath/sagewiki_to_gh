= Sage days Marseille =

We aim to organize between September and December 2014 a week-long sage days related to word combinatorics, group theory and symbolic dynamics.

== Potential thematics ==

 * word combinatorics (algorithms on words, languages, automata, ...)
 * group theory (free groups, surface groups, braid groups)
 * symbolic dynamics (substitutive, sofic, ...)


== People who plan to intend ==

=== Local people ===

 * Paul Mercat (some code for automata related to development in base beta)
 * Thierry Coulbois (some [[https://github.com/coulbois/sage-train-track|code for free group]])
 * Pierre Guillon (interested in languages)

=== People for organisation ===

 * Thierry Monteil
 * Vincent Delecroix

=== Invitation ===

 * MichaÃ«l Rao




== Organisation ==

=== Schedule ===

We would like to have both lectures/tutorials for local Sage newcommers and development time.

=== Location ===

Probably [[http://frumam.cnrs-mrs.fr/|Frumam]]

=== Dates ===

To be decided.
