= AIM SQUARE -- Explicit Reduction Theories (Feb 21-25, 2011) =

== Purpose ==

This is a proposal to gather researchers with distinct perspectives on the topic of explicit computational methods for reduction theories and their application to study geometry, cohomology, and modular forms. The purpose of our week-long collaboration is to:

 1. Discuss/share current methods for using explicit reduction domains, and interesting open problems.

 2. Lay the groundwork for creating a unified computational framework for explicit reduction theory computations in SAGE, and discuss how to combine existing specialized projects to this end. 

 3. Set concrete goals for future collaborations and software development.
