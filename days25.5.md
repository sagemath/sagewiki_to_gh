= Sage Day 25.5: Introduction to Sage and Combinatorics =

[[/francais|Version française ici]]

== One Day : Wednesday, September 1st, 2010 ==

== Location : SH-3420, LaCIM, UQAM, Montréal, Canada ==

  * Room SH-3420 is located in the [[http://www.uqam.ca/campus/pavillons/sh.htm|Sherbrooke Building]]
  * [[http://lacim.uqam.ca/|LaCIM - Laboratoire de combinatoire et d'informatique mathématique]]

== Context ==

Held in sandwich between [[http://lacim2010.lacim.uqam.ca/|LaCIM 2010 - 20th aniversary]] and [[http://gascom2010.lacim.uqam.ca/|GASCom]] conferences, this day is an opportunity for their participants to learn more about [[http://sagemath.org/|Sage]]. Introductory talks will be given and possibly talks or discussions on Sage adapted to the audience of LaCIM 2010 (algebraic combinatorics, theoretical computer science, bioinformatic, physics and number theory) and GASCom (generation of combinatorial objects and bijective combinatorics). Students starting their Autumn semester will be invited as well. The goals are :

  * Introduce the audience to Sage and in particular its combinatorial features
  * Help people installing Sage on their computer
  * Present topics related to LaCIM 2010 and GASCom conferences (e.g. species theory) and how Sage can be helpful
  * Give the opportunity for Sage developpers to meet and discuss
