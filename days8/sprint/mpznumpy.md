# Create a prototype fast numpy matrix with mpz_t (GMP) entries

PEOPLE: Travis Oliphant, William Stein, Josh Kantor 

SUMMARY: Make it so it is possible to make a fast optimized numpy array that represents a multidimensional array of mpz_t's (GMP integers). 

ISSUES: There's never been something like this for non-homogeneous data types.   

STATUS: Nothing done so far.
