=  Further optimize the implementation of Hermite Normal Form in Sage =

PEOPLE: Clement Pernet, William Stein

SUMMARY: Do the following:

   1. Rewrite add row to (a) use a block method, and (b) use fast non-recursive code (it is silly right now).

   2. Implement (or wrap?) Clement's "twice as fast" double det.
