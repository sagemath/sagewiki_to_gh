The workshop has two self-contained parts 

   * a two-day <a class="https" href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> training about general productivity tools 
   * a three-day meeting on mathematical software and databases 
The Software Carpentry workshop (Monday-Tuesday) will likely be delivered in Spanish, but helpers will be able to help participants in other languages including English. 

The rest of the workshop (Wednesday-Friday) should be mostly in English. 

All are welcome and encouraged to attend either or both parts of this workshop! 

   * there will be special focus on getting complete beginners started 
   * we will help semi-beginners get more proficient 
   * we will encourage advanced users to start developing 
   * developers will be able to help other users and will find a good working environment 
The aim is to 

   * gather people from Morelia and more generally from Mexico 
   * introduce them to general and mathematical software tools 
   * help people to implement their own projects 
   * gather developers to improve these systems 
The workshop will include training sessions, talks, tutorials, demos, coding sprints about 

   * general productivity tools such as 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">GNU Bash</a>** 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>** 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>** 
   * general computing and collaboration tools such as 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://cocalc.com/">CoCalc</a>** 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>** 
   * an editing platform with special features for scientists 
         * **<a class="http" href="http://texmacs.org/">GNU TeXmacs</a>** 
   * mathematical software such as 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://github.com/mraggi/discreture">Discreture</a>** 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a>** 
         * **<a class="http" href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">PARI/GP</a>** 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>** 
         * **<a class="https" href="https://github.com/yags/yags/">YAGS</a>** 
   * mathematical databases or packages under development such as 
         * **<a class="http" href="http://www.discretezoo.xyz/">DiscreteZOO</a>** 
         * **<a class="http" href="http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/flatsurf.html">surface-dynamics</a>**

This workshop can be thought of as a Discreture-DiscreteZoo-GAP-PARI-Sage-TeXmacs-YAGS days. In the series of Sage Days, it bears number 92, which lets us use this very convenient wiki. <a class="https" href="https://sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, also known as Sage, is free software for mathematics. 

The focus of this workshop will be on the diversity of the mathematics software ecosystem, and on collaboration between the various systems and communities. 


## Dates and location

The workshop will start on Monday morning, 2018-01-22 and end on Friday evening, 2018-01-26. 

We suggest participants plan to arrive on Sunday, 2018-01-21, and to leave on Saturday, 2018-01-27. (Adapt this if you only attend the Software Carpentry training, or if you skip it.) 

It will take place at <a class="http" href="http://www.enesmorelia.unam.mx/">ENES Morelia</a>, on the <a class="http" href="http://www.morelia.unam.mx/campus/">Morelia campus of UNAM</a>.

We plan two days of <a class="https" href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> training about GNU Bash, Git, and Python, delivered by Software Carpentry instructors. 

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, we will focus on mathematical software and databases with lots of talks, tutorials and demos about the software mentioned above; we will split the 90-minute sessions into 30-minute slots (to be made more precise nearer the event). 

Wednesday afternoon will be free --- an opportunity to explore Morelia's city centre. 

We plan to include a problem session on Thursday afternoon where people can submit their math problems whose solution might involve programming, for everyone to think about.
