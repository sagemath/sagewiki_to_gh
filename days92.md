= Software tools for mathematics --- Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico --- 2018-01-22 -- 2018-01-26 =

This is the webpage for a workshop on '''''Software tools for mathematics'''''
to be held '''''22-26 January 2018''''' in '''''Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico'''''.

The workshop has two self-contained parts

  * a two-day [[https://software-carpentry.org/|Software Carpentry]] training about general productivity tools
  * a three-day part on mathematical software and databases

All are welcome and encouraged to attend either or both parts of this workshop!

  * there will be special focus on getting complete beginners started
  * we will help semi-beginners get more proficient
  * we will encourage advanced users to start developing
  * developers will be able to help other users and will find a good working environment

The aim is to

  * gather people from Morelia and more generally from Mexico
  * introduce them to general and mathematical software tools
  * help people to implement their own projects
  * gather developers to improve these systems

The workshop will include training sessions, talks, tutorials, demos, coding sprints about

  * general productivity tools such as
    * '''[[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/|GNU Bash]]'''
    * '''[[https://git-scm.com/|Git]]'''
    * '''[[https://www.python.org/|Python]]'''
  * general computing and collaboration tools such as
    * '''[[https://cocalc.com/|CoCalc]]'''
    * '''[[https://jupyter.org/|Jupyter]]'''
  * an editing platform with special features for scientists
    * '''[[http://texmacs.org/|GNU TeXmacs]]'''
  * mathematical software such as
    * '''[[https://github.com/mraggi/discreture|Discreture]]'''
    * '''[[https://www.gap-system.org/|GAP]]'''
    * '''[[https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/|Macaulay2]]''' (to be confirmed)
    * '''[[http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/|PARI/GP]]'''
    * '''[[https://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]]'''
    * '''[[https://github.com/yags/yags/|YAGS]]'''
  * mathematical databases or packages under development such as
    * '''[[http://www.discretezoo.xyz/|DiscreteZOO]]'''
    * '''[[http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/flatsurf.html|surface-dynamics]]'''
    * '''[[https://github.com/videlec/sage-flatsurf|sage-flatsurf]]'''

The workshop is also numbered Sage Days 92, which lets us use this very convenient wiki.
[[https://sagemath.org/|SageMath]], also known as Sage, is free software for mathematics.

The focus of this workshop will be on the diversity of the mathematics software ecosystem,
and on collaboration between the various systems and communities.

== Dates and location ==

The workshop will start on Monday morning, 2018-01-22 and end on Friday evening, 2018-01-26.

We suggest participants plan to arrive on Sunday, 2018-01-21, and to leave on Saturday, 2018-01-27.
(Adapt this if you only attend the Software Carpentry training, or if you skip it.)

It will take place at [[http://www.enesmorelia.unam.mx/|ENES Morelia]],
on the [[http://www.morelia.unam.mx/campus/|Morelia campus of UNAM]].

We plan two days of [[https://software-carpentry.org/|Software Carpentry]] training
about GNU Bash, Git, and Python, delivered by Software Carpentry instructors.

Then Wednesday, Thursday and Friday more focus on mathematical software and databases
with lots of talks, tutorials, demos, coding sprints, about the software mentioned above;
slots to be made more precise nearer the event.

Wednesday afternoon will be free --- an opportunity to explore
Morelia and its surroundings (Pátzcuaro, Tzintzuntzan, ...).

We plan to include a problem session on Thursday afternoon where people can submit
their math problems whose solution might involve programming, for everyone to think about.
