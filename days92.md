= Software tools for mathematics --- Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico --- 2018-01-22 -- 2018-01-26 =

This is the webpage for a workshop on '''''Software tools for mathematics'''''
to be held '''''22-26 January 2018''''' in '''''Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico'''''.

All are welcome and encouraged to attend this workshop!

  * there will be special focus on getting complete beginners started
  * we will help semi-beginners get more proficient
  * we will encourage advanced users to start developing
  * developers will be able to help other users and will find a good working environment

The aim is to

  * gather people from Morelia and more generally from Mexico
  * introduce them to general and mathematical software tools
  * help people to implement their own projects
  * gather developers to improve these systems

The workshop will include

  * training sessions in general productivity tools such as
    * '''[[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/|GNU Bash]]'''
    * '''[[https://cocalc.com/|CoCalc]]'''
    * '''[[https://git-scm.com/|Git]]'''
    * '''[[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/|GNU Make]]'''
  * introductions and tutorials to various specialised or generalist mathematical software, such as
    * '''[[https://www.gap-system.org/|GAP]]'''
    * '''[[https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/|Macaulay2]]''' (to be confirmed)
    * '''[[http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/|PARI/GP]]'''
    * '''[[https://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]]'''
    * '''[[https://github.com/yags/yags/|YAGS]]'''
  * projects under development, such as
    * '''[[http://www.discretezoo.xyz/|DiscreteZOO]]'''
    * '''[[http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/flatsurf.html|surface-dynamics]]'''
    * '''[[https://github.com/videlec/sage-flatsurf|sage-flatsurf]]'''

The workshop is also numbered Sage Days 92, which lets us use this very convenient wiki.
[[https://sagemath.org/|SageMath]], also known as Sage, is free software for mathematics.

The focus of this workshop will be on the diversity of the mathematics software ecosystem,
and on collaboration between the various systems and communities.

== Dates and location ==

The workshop will start on Monday morning, 2018-01-22 and end on Friday evening, 2018-01-26.
