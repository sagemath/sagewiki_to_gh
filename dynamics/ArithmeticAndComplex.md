= Arithmetic and Complex Dynamics =

The goal of sage-dynamics is to improve the open source mathematical software Sage for computer exploration in dynamical systems and foster code sharing between researchers in this area. This portion focuses on the Arithmetic (Number Theoretic) and Complex aspects of dynamical systems.

== Road Map ==

The arithmetic and complex dynamics functionality in Sage is currently in its infancy. A significant amount of functionality was developped at the ICERM semester in Spring 2012 and now we have started the process of moving this into Sage through a series of patches (trac tickets). Most of that functionality is current in experimental for that been greatly expanded upon at [[http://wiki.sagemath.org/sagedaysACD | Sage Days 55]]. Much remains to be done. Below you will find a road map of what has been implemented, what is in the process of being implemented, and ideas for future functionality.

=== Wishlist ===

 * Check if for a given algebraic parameter c the map z -> z^2 + c is hyperbolic... and more generally for rational maps of P1 determine the existence (and list) of attracting cycles

 * is_conjugate() for morphisms and iterator over morphisms of fixed degree up to conjugacy (medium)

 * cyclegraph() and orbit_structure() to work with Zmod and other finite spaces not just finite fields (medium)

 * primes_of_bad_reduction() and is_morphism() made to work for endomorphisms of subschemes (easy)

 * products of projective space (Ben Hutz)

 * dynamics on Wehler K3 surfaces (Joao de Faria)

 * error_bound computation for canonical height in dimension > 1

 * update affine space to include the appropriate functionality from projective space

 * enumeration of points of small height over number fields for affine and projective spaces

 * fix all the white space issues in the projective and affine folders (easy)

 * specific functionality for regular polynomial endomorphisms of P^N (Patrick might start implementing this someday)

 * Chebyshev creator (if it doesn't already exist)

 * moduli space invariants - symmetric functions in multipliers of periodic points, others...

 * use real interval field for floating point computations (in heights and possibly rational preperiodic point functions)

 * issue with dynatomic polynomials (see (5) from ([[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14219|#14219]])

 * reduced form of endomorphisms -  i.e., compute an `SL(2,Z)` transformation that makes the coefficients small. The simplest approach would be to "reduce" the binary form describing the fixed points or (if that's too degenerate) the points of period n for some small n. See [Stoll, Michael; Cremona, John E., On the reduction theory of binary forms. J. Reine Angew. Math. 565 (2003), 79â€“99.], which is fairly easy to implement and which would be useful to have in sage anyway.

 * some kind of coersion model: if you have a map defined over QQ should you be able to take the image of a point over CC (i.e. somewhere you have a well defined embedding) without having to `change_ring()`. Something like this works for polynomials. This may or may not be a good idea, but if it can be done in a consistent manner it would improve usability in certain situations.

 * Ponies (Patrick)

 * PLEASE ADD MORE...
