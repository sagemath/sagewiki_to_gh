= Arithmetic and Complex Dynamics =

The goal of sage-dynamics is to improve the open source mathematical software Sage for computer exploration in dynamical systems and foster code sharing between researchers in this area. This portion focuses on the Arithmetic (Number Theoretic) and Complex aspects of dynamical systems.

== Road Map ==

The arithmetic and complex dynamics functionality in Sage is currently in its infancy. A significant amount of functionality was developped at the ICERM semester in Spring 2012 and now we have started the process of moving this into Sage through a series of patches (trac tickets). Most of that functionality is current in experimental for that been greatly expanded upon at [[http://wiki.sagemath.org/sagedaysACD | Sage Days 55]]. Much remains to be done. Below you will find a road map of what has been implemented, what is in the process of being implemented, and ideas for future functionality.
