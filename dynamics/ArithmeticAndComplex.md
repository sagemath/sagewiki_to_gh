= Arithmetic and Complex Dyanmics =

The goal of sage-dynamics is to improve the open source mathematical software Sage for computer exploration in dynamical systems and foster code sharing between researchers in this area. This portion focuses on the Arithmetic (Number Theoretic) and Complex aspects of dynamical systems.

== Road Map ==

The arithmetic and complex dynamics functionality in Sage is currently in its infancy. A significant amount of functionality was developped at the ICERM semester in Spring 2012 and now we have started the process of moving this into Sage through a series of patches (trac tickets). Most of that functionality is current in experimental form.

 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13130 | Trac #13130 - Merged sage-5.8.beta3]]: Basic architecture changes : support for projective spaces over rings

 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14217 | Trac #14217 - Needs-Review]]: Basic iteration functionality for projective and affine spaces - new directory structure in schemes

 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14218 | Trac #14218 - Needs-Review]]: Height and canonical heights for points and morphisms

 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14129 | Trac #14219 - Owner: bhutz]]: QQ-rational preperiodic algorithms
