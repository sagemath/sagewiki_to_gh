 Sage and Cython: A Brief Introduction <a class="http" href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Open_writing_projects/Sage_and_cython_a_brief_introduction">html</a>  |  en  |  This is a quick introduction to Sage,[...] One thing I will highlight is using Cython in Sage to make very fast code in an easy way.  |  Marshall Hampton  |  -/2008-05-09 
 Number Theory and the RSA Public Key Cryptosystem <a class="http" href="http://nguyenminh2.googlepages.com/sage_numtheory-rsa.pdf">pdf</a>  |  en  |  This tutorial uses Sage to study elementary number theory and the RSA public key cryptosystem. A number of Sage commands will be introduced that help us to perform basic number theoretic operations such as greatest common divisor and Euler’s phi function. We then introduce the RSA cryptosystem and use Sage’s built-in commands to encrypt and decrypt data via the RSA algorithm.  |  Minh Van Nguyen  |  2008-11-04/2009-07-25

## Wish List

This is a list of requested documentations. 
 **Type**  |  **Priority**  |  **lang**  |  **Purpose and Direction** 
 HowTo  |  high  |  en  |  Setup Sage in a classroom situation as a central server. 
 Examples  |  medium  |  en  |  Plotting of functions, examples how various kinds of functions can be plotted, explain parameters 
 Numbertypes and Conversation  |  high  |  en  |  Write a guide explaining the different types of numbers in Sage. What are they for (examples), how to convert, which modules are available (e.g. how works Sage->Python->Mpmath ?) and so on. Should target new Sage users, especially if they are used to simpler environments without different number types. Should be part of "_Tutorial_" 


## Types

Some definitions on what is what in the list above. (If someone has better definitions, please edit!) 

* _Howto_: Basic step-by-step guide with screenshots, easy to use, straightforward, probably often updated. 
* _Tutorial_: Explain a topic, how to do something, similar to howto... 
* _Guide_: More general than howto and tutorial. For example, explain background knowledge and connect the dots. 
* _Examples_: List examples on a particular topic. The levels "beginner", "advanced" and "pro" can be used to indicate the level of prior knowledge, where "pro" involves knowledge about programming with Sage, i.e. also Python, while "advanced" only requires an understanding of Sage's basic functionalities and an implicit knowledge about Python programming. 
* _Teaching_: Material used in teaching. 

## Writing Great Documentation

Jacob Kaplan-Moss has written a series of three articles on how to write great documentation for any open source project. Here is a list of his articles: 

1. <a class="http" href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/what-to-write/">What to write</a> --- Various types of documents that a project should have, including reference manual, tutorials, brief feature tours, development guidelines, etc. 
1. <a class="http" href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/technical-style/">Technical style</a> --- good technical styles to follow. 
1. <a class="http" href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/editors/">You need an editor</a> -- on the importance of having an editor to look after the project's documentation. 
Darrell Anderson has some tips on technical writing that are well worth a read: 

1. <a class="http" href="http://humanreadable.nfshost.com/howtos/bigshot_words.htm">Bigshot Words</a> --- some words to avoid. <a class="http" href="http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1992-12-21">Dilbert</a> also has some tips. 
1. <a class="http" href="http://humanreadable.nfshost.com/howtos/proofreader.htm">A Proofreader’s Checklist</a> --- common grammatical and spelling mistakes to look out for. 
1. <a class="http" href="http://humanreadable.nfshost.com/howtos/technical_writing_tips.htm">Technical Writing Tips</a> --- numerous points to keep in mind in technical writing.

### Worst-case scenario

Avoid the following scenario as much as possible. This is taken from "Lecture 12: FOSS Culture" of the ANU course <a class="http" href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/students/comp8440/lectures.php">COMP8440</a>:

Subject: Dear Sir,

I have always wanted to flame you, however I never really had any good reason
to do so. While your software creations were always egoistical and
underdocumented, nothing really pushed the mark, yet. Until today, when I
downloaded your "Linux 2.4" call graph utility. So, when is your next absolute-
next-to-worthless but oh-so-cool-because-it's-from-rusty-russell piece of software
coming out? Why the f*** don't you focus on documenting things instead of
writing useless shit that "takes about 8 hours to run on my mobile pII laptop" or
"generates about 180mb of vector postscript". How about another example. I
heard you were involved with that atrocity called "netfilter". Sure, it might have
nice features and I am still considering using it, but WRITE SOME F***ING DOCS
before you release complex shit like this for people to use! When I goto that
netfilter site, I don't give a flying raging f*** who submitted 31337 lines of code to
whatever f***ing netfilter module. That's your egoistical shit, and I could care less
about it.
...... (more rants delted)
... Uhm, that's all I can think of right now.
