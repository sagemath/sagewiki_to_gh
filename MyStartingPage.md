= About this wiki =
This is the wiki for the [[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage - Mathematics Software System]] project. It helps in organizing development, projects and meetings.

'''To access the wiki, use your trac account.'''  See http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ for how to get a trac account. (Spammers: Please don't waste your time trying to get an account, since you have to write an email to a human and convince them you are actually a Sage developer.)
