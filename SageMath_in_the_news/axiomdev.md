Sage got - in my opinion - two things right: it started by packaging many other
excellent, specialised, programs with it, and it is lead by a charismatic,
skilled person.

Axiom, on the other hand, has the problem that it tried to do everything "in
axiom", which works only if you have some 20 mathematicians and another 20
programmers available.  In fact, it won't even work then.
