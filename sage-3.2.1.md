Robert Bradshaw, William Stein, Michael Abshoff: a much simpler and faster algorithm for the divisors function over integers. The new optimized code is faster than a similar integer divisor function in the version of PARI/GP that's bundled with Sage 3.2.1, as well as outperforming a similar integer divisor function found in the version of Magma that Sage 3.2.1 interfaces with.
