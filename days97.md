= Software tools for mathematics • Koper, Slovenia • Mon-Fri 2018-09-24 -- 2018-09-28 =

A workshop on '''''Software tools for mathematics''''' will be held
'''''24-28 September 2018''''' in '''''Koper, Slovenia'''''.

The workshop will focus on the diversity of the mathematics software ecosystem,
and on collaboration between the various systems and communities.

All are invited to participate, regardless of their initial skills in software:
be it to start using mathematics software, to become more proficient users, to
start developing, to meet other developers... We hope everyone will feel welcome
and get the most out of this workshop while helping others get the most of it too.

As a Sage Days, the workshop will bear the number 97. It will not be
only about Sage though -- more of a "GAP + !Sage + other-software days".

== Dates and location ==

The workshop will start on Monday morning, 2018-09-24, and end on Friday
evening, 2018-09-28.

We suggest participants plan to arrive on Sunday, 2018-09-23 (or before)
and leave on Saturday, 2018-09-29 (or after).

There will be an install party on Sunday night for anyone interested.

== Themes, project ==

A tentative list of projects is at [[days97/projects]].

== Schedule ==

To be finalised, taking strong inspiration from the schedule for the
[[days92|"Software tools for mathematics" workshop in Morelia in January 2018]].

We plan two days of [[https://software-carpentry.org/|Software Carpentry]] training,
covering "the Unix shell", "version control with Git", and "programming with GAP",
delivered by Software Carpentry instructors.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, we will focus on mathematical software and
databases with lots of talks, tutorials and demos about the various software
including but not restricted to !CoCalc, DiscreteZOO, GAP, Jupyter, LaTeX, !SageMath.

We plan to include a problem session on Thursday afternoon where people can submit
math problems whose solution might involve programming, for everyone to think about.

== Participants ==

The list of participants will be at [[days97/participants]].
Stay tuned until we put registration in place.
