= Software tools for mathematics • Koper, Slovenia • Mon-Fri 2018-09-24 -- 2018-09-28 =

A workshop on '''''Software tools for mathematics''''' will be held
'''''24-28 September 2018''''' in '''''Koper, Slovenia'''''.

The workshop will focus on the diversity of the mathematics software ecosystem,
and on collaboration between the various systems and communities.

All are invited to participate, regardless of their initial skills in software:
be it to start using mathematics software, to become more proficient users, to
start developing, to meet other developers... We hope everyone will feel welcome
and get the most out of this workshop while helping others get the most of it too.

As a Sage Days, the workshop will bear the number 97. It will not be
only about Sage though -- more of a "GAP + !Sage + other-software days".

== Dates and location ==

The workshop will start on Monday morning, 2018-09-24, and end on Friday
evening, 2018-09-28.

We suggest participants plan to arrive on Sunday, 2018-09-23 (or before)
and leave on Saturday, 2018-09-29 (or after).  

There will be an install party on Sunday night for anyone interested.

== Schedule ==

To be finalised, taking strong inspiration from the schedule for the
[[days92|"Software tools for mathematics" workshop in Morelia in January 2018]].

We will start by two days of Software Carpentry training, covering the [Unix shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), version control with [Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), and programming with [Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/), delivered by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/ "Software Carpentry") instructors.

The GAP mini-course on Wednesday will be led by [Alexander Konovalov](https://alex-konovalov.github.io/year-archive/).

The remaining two days will be dedicated to other math-oriented research tools, such as SageMath and CoCalc ([[slelievre|Samuel Lelièvre]]), LaTeX topics for the working mathematician ([[http://osebje.famnit.upr.si/~nino.basic/|Nino Bašić]]) and contributed talks.

On Thursday afternoon there will be a problem session to give participants an opportunity to submit math problems whose solution might involve programming. There will also be time for discussion about math tools not covered in the workshop.

== Participants ==

The list of participants will be at [[days97/participants]].
Stay tuned until we put registration in place.
