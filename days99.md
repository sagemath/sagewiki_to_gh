== General Information ==

Sage Days 99: SageMath and [[http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/|Macaulay2]] - An Open Source Initiative will be a five-day workshop bringing together developers from the Macaulay2 and Sage communities to discuss, design, and implement new algorithms and computational tools that will be of use to scientists and industry professionals. All software developed during the workshop will be made freely available as part of the open-source mathematics software systems Macaulay2 and Sage. Themes of the workshop include algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, combinatorics, and optimization. The workshop will include talks on target features and the logistics of Macaulay2 and Sage development, as well as working groups on a variety of participant-driven themes.
