= SAGE Bug Squash Day 4 =

The event will take place on '''SATURDAY, October 20''' and officially start at 10 am pacific standard time. It will "officially" go nonstop for 10 hours (until 8pm) and some people will usually meet the day after and finish up some of the leftovers.

Remember the "Twisted Rule" -- Don't work on '''anything''' unless there is a trac ticket for it.
