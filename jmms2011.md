= Notes for the Next Meeting =

Notes, ideas, reminders for the next iteration, in no particular order.

 * Pay for a small table (small was less of a barrier, but barely sufficient)
 * Pay for two chairs (even though expensive)
 * Have 3d glasses---they drew lots of people to the table and into conversation.
 * Business cards were popular and ran out, these are critical
 * Take a projector to have a large screen
 * Or arrange for a local to bring a flat-panel screen (with stand)
 * Hooks or string for banner
 * Decorations (helium balloons, bright candy, etc)
 * Stickers (slide into name-badge, then affix at home)
 * Sage-related textbooks
 * Have a 5-step Quickstart guide to using Sage:
    1. Log into sagenb
    1. Find a quick-start published worksheet
    1. Evaluate a cell
    1. Create a new cell and evaluate 1+1
    1. Create a new cell and evaluate a cool plot
    1. Create a new cell and calculate rref of a matrix
