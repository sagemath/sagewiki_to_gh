My main focus with respect to Sage has been
working on [[http://knoboo.com|Knoboo - Interactive Web Based Programming Notebook]].

Knoboo is functionally similar to the Sage Notebook, but has some unique 
features such as it has a relational database backeded, has a decoupled frontend 
from the computational backend, as well as dynamic Google Docs like
notebook management page and Mathematica like notebook 'Cells'.

Work is still in progress with Knoboo as it is still missing some of the
great usability features of the Sage Notebook like @interact.
Currently you can run Sage with Knoboo and Knoboo is planned for
inclusion in Sage as soon as interaction with Sage is more robust.
