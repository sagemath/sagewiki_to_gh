= Converting Latex Documents to Sage Worksheets =

== Introduction ==

Latex documents can be translated to jsMath, the tool used to render mathematics in the Sage notebook.  This project is about automating the conversion process so that authors can easily use a single command to convert a book-length Latex document to a collection of Sage worksheets.  These could have embedded Sage input cells, possibly containing interacts, and the cross-referencing features of Latex would be preserved in the collection of Sage worksheets.
