This is a informal page for coordinating suggestions on improving the interact command.  At some point it should be either deleted, turned into a trac ticket, or more formal enhancement proposal.  Any commentary on the nuts and bolts of what code should be changed would be appreciated as well.


 Improvement/Suggestion list
    1. Input boxes should have a changable length - sometimes longer inputs are necessary, and these are not handled gracefully.
    2. Controls placed horizontally - it would save a lot of screen real estate if controls could be placed next to each other.
    3. Controls changing state of other controls - currently this is not possible.
    4. Image input - for example, being able to click and drag a point in a displayed image.  Probably hard to implement.
    5. Show current value next to slider control, perhaps also min/max: e.g. {{{[min] |----------------[V]----| value [max]}}}
