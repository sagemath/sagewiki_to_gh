The official webpage of the meeting is at the [[http://www.ima.umn.edu/2013-2014/SW6.1-5.15|IMA website]].

== General Information ==

Sage Days 64.5: Cluster Algebras will be a five-day workshop to design and implement algorithms and computer exploration tools for research in cluster algebras and quiver representations. All software developed during the workshop will be made freely available as part of the free and open-source mathematics software system Sage (http://www.sagemath.org).

The workshop will consist of both talks on cluster algebras (focusing on features to be implemented) as well as on logistics of Sage development. In particular, students and researchers with background in cluster algebras are very welcome to attend and to get involved in computer explorations and development of Sage's cluster package. There will be ample time allotted for design discussions and coding sprints to implement the developed algorithms.

== When and where? ==

June 1-5, 2015, at the IMA, University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, MN, USA.

== Schedule ==

All talks will be held in Lind 305, and all coffee breaks in Lind Hall 400.
