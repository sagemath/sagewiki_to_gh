= Sage Days 113 - Symbolic Computation: Algorithms, Learning and Engineering =

Monday, August 8 to Friday, August 12, 2022
Gebze Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey

[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops|SageDays]] are gatherings of people interested in !SageMath. Sage Days have been organized as local, regional, or international in-person meetings by a wide range of people around the globe. 

SageDays Istanbul is the first event of the project "[[https://sites.google.com/view/matematikcilericinhesaplama/ana-sayfa | Training Mathematicians in Turkey in Computation]]" supported by an IMU CDC grant for 2022-2023, hosted by Istanbul Center for Mathematical Sciences(ICMS).

SageDays 113 will be followed by two conferences, Applications of Computer Algebra(ACA) on 15-19 August 2022 and Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing (CASC) on 22-26 August 2022 at the same venue, Gebze Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey. All these events are part of the umbrella event Symbolic Computation: Algorithms, Learning and Engineering([[https://scale.gtu.edu.tr/|SCALE]]).



== Topics and goals ==
This will be first SageDays in Turkey, hence one of the main goals is to start a Sage community. 

== About SageMath ==

[[https://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]], or Sage for short, is a mature, comprehensive, free (open-source) mathematics software system based on Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License, that integrates computer algebra facilities and general computational packages. 

Sage, first released in 2005, in over a decade of incubation in the  [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs|SageMath distribution, comprising 293 software packages]], has grown its own [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage|library of 1000 Cython and over 4400 Python modules]], ranging from `sage.algebras.*` over `sage.geometry.*` to `sage.tensor.*`, with a total of over 2.2 million lines of code.  

== How to register and participate ==

Registration is done through the umbrella event [[https://scale.gtu.edu.tr/|SCALE 2022 webpage]].

Free accomodation is offered to students. All participants can request travel and accomodation support.
