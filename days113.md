# Sage Days 113 - Symbolic Computation: Algorithms, Learning and Engineering

Monday, August 8 to Friday, August 12, 2022 Gebze Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey 

<a class="https" href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops">SageDays</a> are gatherings of people interested in SageMath. Sage Days have been organized as local, regional, or international in-person meetings by a wide range of people around the globe.  

<a href="/SageDays">SageDays</a> Istanbul is the first event of the project "<a class="https" href="https://sites.google.com/view/matematikcilericinhesaplama/ana-sayfa">Training Mathematicians in Turkey in Computation</a>" supported by an IMU CDC grant for 2022-2023, hosted by Istanbul Center for Mathematical Sciences(ICMS). 

<a href="/SageDays">SageDays</a> 113 will be followed by two conferences, Applications of Computer Algebra(ACA) on 15-19 August 2022 and Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing (CASC) on 22-26 August 2022 at the same venue, Gebze Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey. All these events are part of the umbrella event Symbolic Computation: Algorithms, Learning and Engineering(<a class="https" href="https://scale.gtu.edu.tr/">SCALE</a>). 


## Topics and goals

This will be first <a href="/SageDays">SageDays</a> in Turkey, hence one of the main goals is to start a Sage community.  


## About SageMath

<a class="https" href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, or Sage for short, is a mature, comprehensive, free (open-source) mathematics software system based on Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License, that integrates computer algebra facilities and general computational packages.  

Sage, first released in 2005, in over a decade of incubation in the  <a class="https" href="https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs">SageMath distribution, comprising 293 software packages</a>, has grown its own <a class="https" href="https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage">library of 1000 Cython and over 4400 Python modules</a>, ranging from `sage.algebras.*` over `sage.geometry.*` to `sage.tensor.*`, with a total of over 2.2 million lines of code.   


## How to register and participate

Registration is done through the umbrella event <a class="https" href="https://scale.gtu.edu.tr/">SCALE 2022 webpage</a>.
