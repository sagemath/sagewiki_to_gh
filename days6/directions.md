== Train and bus directions ==
There are two mainline railway stations in Bristol, Temple Meads and
Parkway. If you have a choice, you are advised to arrive at Temple
Meads as it is much closer to the University precinct. Bus services
8/8A or 9/9A run to the precinct every 10 minutes during the day, and
taxis are readily available.
To get to Maths, Take service 9 or 9A, disembark outside the
Hawthorns on Elton Road. Go across the zebra crossing (Woodland
Rd), turn right, cross the next road, and go up the drive in front of
you, marked Stuart House. This will bring you to the front of Royal
Fort and Stuart House. To access the maths building bear left, past
the front of the houses, under the arch (prince Rupertâ€™s Gate) and
turn right at the next road. The main entrance is a few yards along, up
the steps to your right.

== Airport directions ==
To get to the Maths department, and Royal Fort, from the airport you
can either take a taxi, or use the Airport flyer bus service, which will
take you into the city centre. The bus ride will take you approximately 40 minutes. 

The airport bus number 330  goes very close to the hotel after
stopping at the main station (Temple Meads).  The other one (number
331) does not.

== Hotel ==
All invited participants will be staying in the Marriott Hotel on
College Green (near Bristol Cathedral).  Be careful:  there is at
least one other Marriott Hotel in central Bristol!  Their room charges
including breakfast will be met by the Heilbronn Institute (University
of Bristol) but extras will have to be paid for.
