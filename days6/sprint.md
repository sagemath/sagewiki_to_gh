= Sage Days 6 Coding Sprints =

List any and all project ideas here.

 * Number fields -- Reduction modulo a prime ideal, or any ideal.

 * Number fields --optimize K([1,2,3]).

 * Timing of doctests (partially done)

 * Double question mark for spyx files doesn't work.; docstrings work.

 * Markup Cython code based on what C code it generates.

 * R Python expect interface

 * Redo all the "edwards coord" proofs in Sage instead of Magma.  See email to sagedays6, along with http://hyperelliptic.org/EFD/edwards.html

 * Fix computing trace over $\mathbf{F}_q$ algebraically. 

 * ATLAS into Sage on Linux. 

 * Linbox -- get rid of all the crappy hacks for minpoly/charpoly

 * Linbox -- fix wrapping of smith_form problems.

 * Create pickle database

 * Document number fields. 

 * Compute kernels of matrices over $\mathbf{Z}/p^n\mathbf{Z}$.
