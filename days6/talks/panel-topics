Suggested discussion topics for panel discussion on 

	  "The Future of Open Source Mathematical Software"

			     SAGE Days 6

		       Sunday 11 November 2007

Chair: John Cremona

Panel members: William Stein, Robert Bradshaw, Ondrej Certik, Bill
	       Alombert, Michael Abshoff, Dan Bernstein.


(1) What are the strength and weaknesses of open source versus closed
    source software?

--Can we trust results of computer algebra systems/ mathematics
  software that is closed source?  Or of any software at all?

--Should a paper submitted for publication in a journal be rejected if
  it fundamentally depends on closed source software? Or on any
  software at all?

(2) Is it possible to provide a truly viable open source alternative
    to Maple, Matlab, Mathematica, and Magma that will survive the
    standard 30 year software lifespan and be well supported?

(3) Is it likely that any of the following mathematical software
    systems will be open sourced within the next five years: Matlab,
    Maple, Mathematica, Magma, Mupad, Reduce?   Or that they will be
    replaced by viable OSS alternatives?

(4) Do 'we' have to protect our OSS using a copyright such as
    the GPL, or should we just release public domain to avoid the
    hassle (see GPLv3)?  [Discussion on this point will be strictly
    guillotined.]

(5) Discuss ideas for funding the creation of open source mathematical
    software, and of improving the *quality* of open mathematical
    software (e.g., testing, bug days, trac, etc., language choices,
    etc.).

(6) Should software implementations be treated more like journal
    submissions, being refereed and hence putting computational work
    on the same footing as more theoretical work in the context of
    academic credit?   (cf JSage)
