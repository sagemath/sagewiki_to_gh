== Announcement ==

In 2016, 2017 and 2018, we ran week long
[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77|developers days]] in
a [[http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/de-toren/|cosy guest house]]
in Cernay, just short of an hour from Paris by public transport,
on *packaging, portability, interfaces, and documentation tools for
Sage and GAP*. It was fun and productive and we are organizing a follow up:
same location, same themes.

If you are interested in participating, please fill/edit the
[[https://framadate.org/hhzG3ZtTQEi1HG2V|poll]] with the
tentative meals and nights you will be there, and fill in the participants,
arrivals, and cooking sections on the [[https://hackmd.io/j5FzB173Q4uaExUw-6Glpg#|pad]].

Notes:
 * Other themes around Sage, GAP, ... are welcome; feel free to join and work with us.
 * The guest house is actually rented Saturday to Saturday; everybody is welcome to stay for the whole duration.
