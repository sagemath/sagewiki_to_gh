## Announcement

In 2016, 2017 and 2018, we ran week long <a class="https" href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77">developers days</a> in a <a class="http" href="http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/de-toren/">cosy guest house</a> in Cernay, just short of an hour from Paris by public transport, on *packaging, portability, interfaces, and documentation tools for Sage and GAP*. It was fun and productive and we are organizing a follow up: same location, same themes. 

If you are interested in participating, please fill/edit the <a class="https" href="https://framadate.org/hhzG3ZtTQEi1HG2V">poll</a> with the tentative meals and nights you will be there, and fill in the participants, arrivals, and cooking sections on the <a class="https" href="https://hackmd.io/j5FzB173Q4uaExUw-6Glpg#">pad</a>. 

Notes: 

* Other themes around Sage, GAP, ... are welcome; feel free to join and work with us. 
* The guest house is actually rented Saturday to Saturday; everybody is welcome to stay for the whole duration. 

## Funding

The workshop is funded by <a class="http" href="http://opendreamkit.org/">OpenDreamKit</a>, with material help from the Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, the Mathematics and the Computer Science Departments at Université Paris-Sud, Orsay.
