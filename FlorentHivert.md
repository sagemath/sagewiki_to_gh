I'm a researcher in algebraic combinatorics at the University of Rouen in Normandie, France. My research heavily rely on computer exploration. Therefore I used to be with NicolasThi√©ry one of the main developpers of MuPAD-Combinat. Last summer, we decided to join Sage. My main focus as combinatoric and in particular cleaning up the design and the category system.
