I'm a researcher in algebraic combinatorics at the University of Rouen in Normandie, France. My research heavily rely on computer exploration. Therefore I used to be with NicolasThi√©ry one of the main developpers of MuPAD-Combinat. Last summer, we decided to join Sage so, despite the fact that currently I still need my former system to do my research, I strongly want to switch to sage as soon as possible.
