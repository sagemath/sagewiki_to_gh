Back to <a href="/days7">Days 7</a> main page. 

In the old tradition of Sage Days (see <a href="/days4/projects/redbull">Days 4: Staple the Dead Beaver to the Sidewalk!</a>), I've started a page for well, stapling beavers and what have you... 

I'll start with a weak reference to Sage, found on the Ave when I was getting lunch today (yesterday).  At first glance, I did think that "Arabic" said "Algebraic".
