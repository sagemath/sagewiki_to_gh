== Acceptance Criteria for standard packages ==
This criteria is for ''acceptance'' of standard packages, not the criteria for consideration of packages. 

 1. GPL version 3 compatible license
 1. The package must build on our supported architectures and pass the worry test (e.g., what is the possibility of eventually using the package on Windows?)
 1. Quality: It should be "better" than anything else (that passes criteria 1 and 2) and the argument should be made for this.  The comparison should be made to both python and other software.  Criteria in passing the quality test include:
  1. Speed
  1. Documentation
  1. Usability
  1. Memory leaks
  1. Maintainable
 1. Interest and Demand:
  1. JSAGE vote
  1. sage-devel +1 votes (and sage-support votes)
  1. How many downloads of the optional package
