== Debian release to support ==

sbuild: lenny x86-64: can create 32 & 64 bit arch specific packages, ~12 in total:

 * Ubuntu LTS
 * last two Ubuntu releases
 * >=etch

== Make check ==
 * use schroot to run "make check"

== Problematic Packages ==

 * ATLAS  (atlas-sage-x.y or version bump)
 * Python (python-sage-x.y or version bump)
 * jmol - potential conflict with gcj in stable (testing and above fine)
 * Maxima: copies mgnuplot script to libexec (Maxima is already in Debian)

== Changelog ==

 * needs to be kept in sync with SPKG.txt (automated mechanism)
 * dch (Debian changelog)

== Initially ==
 * webserver for static only content
 * set up apt-get repo on $SAGE.MATH
 * To set up repo: reprpro + gpg key for signing
 * domain: http://debian.sagemath.org registered, still points at sagemath.org, needs vhost to be set up

== Problem to be solved ==

 * Install location: /usr/share/sage/ - "sage" script in bin does cd and 
   then execute the appropriate sage scipt in /usr/share/sage/
 * location of tmp, i.e. $TMP, /tmp or /var/tmp, not $SAGE_ROOT/tmp
 * SAGE_ROOT/ipython - why is it there. What is the content (config files?)
 * databases in $SAGE_ROOT/data -> /use/share/sage/data
 * spkg directory: gone or moved to sage-dev.deb
 * make distclean: remove "*.c", "*.so", "*.os" in /devel/sage/
 * content of examples directory: What to do with the code?
 * LIB -> lib - Singular related, move to lib/Singular
 * text files from $SAGE_ROOT: /usr/share/doc/sage
 * create official Sage GPG key to sign packages

== Package names ==
 
 * Comply with Debian policy when possible
 * libraries (for example NTL):
  * ntl_5.4.1-1.dsc (the source source package), tarball with debian directory
  * libntl0_5.4.1-1_i386.deb (initial NTL version, i.e. "0", contains shared library) 
  * libntl-dev_5.4.1-1_i386.deb (headers & static libraries)
 * binary (eclib)
  * eclib_1.0_i386.deb (binaries)
  * libec0_1.0_i386.deb (shared libraries)
  * libec-dev_1.0_i386.deb (headers & static libraries)
 * Singular
  * To be determined

== Setting up the build system (In Detail) ==

 * based on build system for [http://debathena.mit.edu Debian-Athena]
 * Start Debian installer
 * Partitioning method: "Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM" - accept defaults and write LVM init to disk
 * delete original main LVM volume, create new VG, say with 10GB
 * set up accounts for root and users as usual
 * update to lenny: edit /etc/apt/source and replace "etch" with "lenny"
 * "aptitude update"
 * "aptitude dist-upgrade" (wait a while :) )
 * download Tim's script collection from the main Deb packaging page [http://www.sagemath.org:9001/days7/DebianPackagingSprint?action=AttachFile (tarballs here for now)], untar ... [the code is being partially merged in the sage-scripts repo, some of the other might end up on a wiki page somewhere else once this is over]
 * file "packages" contains list of packages needed for the build system
 * aptitude install `cat packages` installs the packages listed in packages.  Also install cdbs.
 * file "approx.conf.tail": append file to approx.conf - make sure to set a fast mirror, i.e. not the MIT repo
 * restart approx service via "/etc/init.d/approx restart"
 * edit make-chroot and set $VG to volume group name or export VG
 * Now create change roots for various targets using make-chroot: Parameters $1 is SUITE (i.e. lenny), $2 is ARCH (i.e. i386)
 * If things go wrong remove lvm group created :(
 * download Tim's other script collection from the main Deb packaging page [http://www.sagemath.org:9001/days7/DebianPackagingSprint?action=AttachFile (tarballs for now)], untar into /usr/local/bin ...
 * export DEBATHENA_APT=(path to SAGE apt repository)
 * adduser sage sbuild (where sage is a user you want to be able to do builds)

== Using the chroot environments ==
 * Create GPG key: gpg --gen-key (follow instructions)
 * export key in ascii format: gpg --export -armor > sage-archive.asc
 * mount-defaults: uncomment /dev/pts, tmpfs mounts since there are currently problems with schroot 1.1.6-1. P potential solution: uncomment  /dev/pts, /dev/shm mount points
 * starting schroot env: example gutsy:
   
    schroot -c gutsy-i386-sbuild

== To actually do builds ==
 * get SAGE .spkg and unpack into DIR
 * copy debian directory into $DIR/src
 * build source package using debuild -S from inside package directory ($DIR/src)
 * build binary packages using "da sbuildhack [resulting .dsc file]" from $DIR
 * upload into SAGE repository using "daupload-release [resulting .changes file]" from $DIR
 * use clean-schroots whenever you run out of disk space due to stale build chroots (often get leaked when you do ^C during a build)

 * autotools-dev, m4 (should be added to the dependencies - if they aren't)

 * using sbuildhack  - setup: adduser $USER sbuild [make sure user is in right group]
 * {{{/etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf}}}:
      * set mailto, maintainer, etc...
      * uncomment '$sbuild_mode = "user";'

=== Example ===

 * apt-get source valgrind [downloads sources, patches, dsc file]
 * sbuildhack lenny-i386 valgrind-3.3.0-1.dsc

 * Building a Debian package via {{{make}}} from {{{$SAGE_LOCAL}}}:
   * set env variable {{{DEBIAN_RELEASE}}} to "lenny-i386" [building deb in schroot env]
   * set env variable {{{USEDEB}}} to "yes": first try to sudo apt-get install {{{$SPKG.deb}}}
   * sage-spkg: check if {{{DEBIAN_RELEASE}}} is set: if spkg-debian exists in {{{$SPKG_ROOT}}} execute it, otherwise do default sbuildhack - see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/2098 for patch


== Structure for dist-specific build systems in general ==

 * Can expect upstream sources to be available at {{{$SPKG_ROOT/src}}}
 * Can store distribution-specific files in {{{$SPKG_ROOT/dist/$NAME}}}

== Possibly useful links ==

 * Debian alternatives system: see [http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/91], [http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=update-alternatives&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=Debian+Sid&format=html&locale=en]
