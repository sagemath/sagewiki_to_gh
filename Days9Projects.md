= Sage days 9 Student Projects =
Please add your project to this list. Follow the example.

 * ''John Doe, Jane Deer'': '''Graphing antlers'''. The branching of the antlers of three year-old moose and cariboo form intricate mathematical patterns. We will produce an applet that illustrates the growth of these structures.

 * ''Mclean Edwards, Scott Zhou'': "BFGS Iterates".  Plotting iterates, in an interactive manner, of the celebrated BFGS method applied to nonconvex and convex functions.  Comparison of sage, jyscript/piscript, and our own python-based solutions.

 * ''Jakub Marecek'': '''Toy Integer Programming Solver'''.  A very limited integer programming solver for instances with 3 variables, but complete with several primal (and possibly branching) heuristics in use today, and nice plots. Coming soon at http://cs.nott.ac.uk/~jxm/ -- hopefully as Java WebStart. '''SVG and PDF Output for JyScript'''. A quick hack using Apache Batik.  

 * ''Aurel Meyer'': '''Symmetry groups of polytopes'''.  Graphics to illustrate that all symmetry groups of regular polytopes are finite Coxeter groups.
