# Sage days 9 Student Projects

Please add your project to this list. Follow the examples that are already there. 

* _Adrian Belshaw_: **Unimodular Polynomials.** Using Sage to draw unimodualr polynomials on the unit circle in the complex plane. 
* _Arnaud Bergeron_: **Better adaptive plotting in Sage**.  At William's request, I am working on better adaptive refinement for Sage's plot() command. 
* _Drew Chorney_: **Fundamental Domains of Congruence Subgroups and an Animation of a Geodesic :**Some Geodesic's on the identification space of a fundamental domain for PSL(2,Z) in jyscript. And visualization of fundamental domains for congruence subgroups using SAGE.   
* _Mclean Edwards, Scott Zhou_: **BFGS Iterates**.  Plotting iterates, in an interactive manner, of the celebrated BFGS method for the minimization of nonconvex and convex functions.  Comparison of sage, jyscript/piscript, and our own python-based solutions. 
* _Adam Getchell_: **Nonlinear Dynamics in SAGE**. Illustrate and solve solutions to non-linear equations. Add basic cobweb diagrams. Wrap Maxima's CTensor package and compare speed with SAGE's Christoffel symbol calculation in calculus/tests.py.   
* _Yair Go1dberg_: **3D Graphing in <a href="/PiScript">PiScript</a>**. Plotting 3 dimensional functions in <a href="/PiScript">PiScript</a>. 
* _Ryan Hoban_: **Geometric Structures**. Using sage to draw geometric structures in the Hyperbolic plane. (Slides available <a class="http" href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~rfhoban/GeometricStructures.pdf">here</a>) 
* _Steve Kieffer_: **Algebra sketches**. Tools with which to produce sketches of a kind often drawn on blackboards to illustrate algebraic structures. 
* _Avra Laarakker_: **Properties of Digit Sets and Dilation Matrices using Sage**. Given a dilation matrix A, and a digit set D, want to see visually if a tiling of Z^n is possible.  
* _Sébastien Labbé_: **Combinatorics on words**. 
                     1. Use colors and @interact of sage to study equations on words. 
                              * <a class="http" href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/Days9Projects?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Equations_on_words_with_color.sws">Equations_on_words_with_color.sws</a> (Next version of <a class="http" href="http://code.google.com/p/sage-words/">sage-words package</a> needed to run it!!) 
                     1. Use jyscript and jython to create a java applet to illustrate Christoffel words 
                              * <a class="http" href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/Days9Projects?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=ChristoffelWord.py">ChristoffelWord.py</a> 
                     1. Add gridlines support for show() in sage. Franco Saliola improved *a lot* my initial patch by changing it all (!!) and added many options to make it work like in Matematica. See <a class="http" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3825">Ticket #3825</a> 
* _Michael Lamoureux_: **<a href="/EasyBalls">EasyBalls</a>**. A 2D animation of colliding balls, maybe with gravity, maybe with E&M if I can get the 3D in there. 
* _Jakub Marecek_: **Toy Integer Programming Solver**.  A very limited integer programming solver for instances with 3 variables, but complete with several primal heuristics in use today, and visualising the workings nicely. See <a class="http" href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/JakubMarecek">here</a> for more. 
* _Aurel Meyer_: **Symmetry groups of polytopes**.  Graphics to illustrate that all symmetry groups of regular polytopes are finite Coxeter groups. 
* _Zhivko Nedev_: **Encoding/Representing a class of combinatorial structures and making tools for their visualization and analysis**. The comb. structure is a MINIMAL edge coloring of K_n, the complete graph, with the following properties: 
                     1. No two adjacent edges have the same color. 
                     1. Our coloring splits the set of edges of K_n into color classes; we require that every class has at least two members.  
                     1. The coloring is minimal by inclusion. That is, if we delete any subset of vertices  of K_n (and any adjacent edges), then property 2 is violated - there will be at least one color class with one member.  
* _Olesya Peshko_: **Intensity-based Image Segmentation Tool** A simple segmentation tool which shows regions of the image (represented by a 2D or 3D matrix of pixel/voxel intensity values) in different colours for easy visualization of the structures shown in the image.  
* _Ignacio Rozada_: **Python and PDE's.** Solving and plotting numerical solutions to reaction-diffusion partial differential equations on growing domains; a comparison between scipy-matplotlib and matlab. 
* _Véronique Sangin-Gagnon_: **Triangle Hyperbolic Group** Graphics that show the representation of a hyperbolic group.  
* _Matthew Stamps_: **Topological Methods for Determining Graph Colourablility** Graph colouring problems are, in general, very difficult and often require a wide variety of mathematical techniques to solve.  A number of topological methods for bounding the chromatic number of a graph have been developed over the last 30 years.  I will introduce one such approach with the help of an interactive graph editor I developed in <a href="/PiScript/JyScript">PiScript/JyScript</a> this week.
