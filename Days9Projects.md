Please add your project to this list. Follow the example.

 * ''John Doe, Jane Deer'': '''Graphing antlers'''. The branching of the antlers of three year-old moose and cariboo form intricate mathematical patterns. We will produce an applet that illustrates the growth of these structures.
 * ''Mclean Edwards, Scott Zhou'': '''BFGS Iterates'''.  Plotting iterates, in an interactive manner, of the celebrated BFGS method applied to nonconvex and convex functions.  Comparison of sage, jyscript/piscript, and our own python-based solutions.
 * ''Jakub Marecek'': '''Toy Integer Programming Solver'''.  A very limited integer programming solver for instances with 3 variables, but complete with several primal heuristics in use today, and visualising the workings nicely. '''SVG and PDF Output for JyScript'''. A quick hack using Apache Batik. 
 * ''Aurel Meyer'': '''Symmetry groups of polytopes'''.  Graphics to illustrate that all symmetry groups of regular polytopes are finite Coxeter groups.
 * ''Yair Go1dberg'': '''3D Graphing in PiScript'''. Plotting 3 dimensional functions in PiScript.
 * ''Steve Kieffer'': '''Algebra sketches'''. Tools with which to produce sketches of a kind often drawn on blackboards to illustrate algebraic structures.
