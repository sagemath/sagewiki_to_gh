 * ''Mclean Edwards, Scott Zhou'': '''BFGS Iterates'''.  Plotting iterates, in an interactive manner, of the celebrated BFGS method applied to nonconvex and convex functions.  Comparison of sage, jyscript/piscript, and our own python-based solutions.

 * ''Jakub Marecek'': '''Toy Integer Programming Solver'''.  A very limited integer programming solver for instances with 3 variables, but complete with several primal heuristics in use today, and visualising the workings nicely. '''SVG and PDF Output for JyScript'''. A quick hack using Apache Batik. 

 * ''Aurel Meyer'': '''Symmetry groups of polytopes'''.  Graphics to illustrate that all symmetry groups of regular polytopes are finite Coxeter groups.

 * ''Yair Go1dberg'': '''3D Graphing in PiScript'''. Plotting 3 dimensional functions in PiScript.

 * ''Steve Kieffer'': '''Algebra sketches'''. Tools with which to produce sketches of a kind often drawn on blackboards to illustrate algebraic structures.
 
 * ''Michael Lamoureux'': '''EasyBalls'''. A 2D animation of colliding balls, maybe with gravity, maybe with E&M if I can get the 3D in there.
