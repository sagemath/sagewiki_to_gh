Please add your project to this list. Follow the examples that are already there.

 * ''Mclean Edwards, Scott Zhou'': '''BFGS Iterates'''.  Plotting iterates, in an interactive manner, of the celebrated BFGS method for the minimization of nonconvex and convex functions.  Comparison of sage, jyscript/piscript, and our own python-based solutions.
 * ''Jakub Marecek'': '''Toy Integer Programming Solver'''.  A very limited integer programming solver for instances with 3 variables, but complete with several primal heuristics in use today, and visualising the workings nicely. (Java & vtkHull?)
  . Further ideas: '''SVG and PDF Output for JyScript'''. A quick hack using Apache Batik (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/). '''TeX and PS and PDF Output for SAGE'''. A quick hack using Sketch (http://www.frontiernet.net/~eugene.ressler/).
 * ''Aurel Meyer'': '''Symmetry groups of polytopes'''.  Graphics to illustrate that all symmetry groups of regular polytopes are finite Coxeter groups.
 * ''Yair Go1dberg'': '''3D Graphing in PiScript'''. Plotting 3 dimensional functions in PiScript.
 * ''Steve Kieffer'': '''Algebra sketches'''. Tools with which to produce sketches of a kind often drawn on blackboards to illustrate algebraic structures.
 * ''Michael Lamoureux'': '''EasyBalls'''. A 2D animation of colliding balls, maybe with gravity, maybe with E&M if I can get the 3D in there.
 * ''Ryan Hoban'': '''Hyperbolic Geometry'''. Using sage to draw geometric structures in the Hyperbolic plane.
 * ''Sébastien Labbé'': '''Combinatorics on words'''. 
        1. Use colors and @interact of sage to study equations on words.
           [http://wiki.sagemath.org/Days9Projects?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Equations_on_words_with_color.sws Equations_on_words_with_color.sws] (Next version of [http://code.google.com/p/sage-words/ sage-words package] needed to run it!!)
        2. Use jyscript and jython to create a java applet to illustrate Christoffel words 
           [http://wiki.sagemath.org/Days9Projects?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=ChristoffelWord.py ChristoffelWord.py]
