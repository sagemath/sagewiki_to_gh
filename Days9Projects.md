Please add your project to this list. Follow the examples that are already there.

 * ''Adrian Belshaw'': '''Unimodular Polynomials.''' Using Sage to draw unimodualr polynomials on the unit circle in the complex plane.

 * ''Arnaud Bergeron'': '''Better adaptive plotting in Sage'''.  At William's request, I am working on better adaptive refinement for Sage's plot() command.

 * ''Mclean Edwards, Scott Zhou'': '''BFGS Iterates'''.  Plotting iterates, in an interactive manner, of the celebrated BFGS method for the minimization of nonconvex and convex functions.  Comparison of sage, jyscript/piscript, and our own python-based solutions.

 * ''Adam Getchell'': '''Nonlinear Dynamics in SAGE'''. Illustrate and solve solutions to non-linear equations. Add basic cobweb diagrams. Wrap Maxima's CTensor package and compare speed with SAGE's Christoffel symbol calculation in calculus/tests.py.  

 * ''Yair Go1dberg'': '''3D Graphing in PiScript'''. Plotting 3 dimensional functions in PiScript.

 * ''Ryan Hoban'': '''Hyperbolic Geometry'''. Using sage to draw geometric structures in the Hyperbolic plane.

 * ''Steve Kieffer'': '''Algebra sketches'''. Tools with which to produce sketches of a kind often drawn on blackboards to illustrate algebraic structures.

 * ''Avra Laarakker'': '''Properties of Digit Sets and Dilation Matrices using Sage'''. Given a dilation matrix A, and a digit set D, want to see visually if a tiling of Z^n is possible. 

 * ''Sébastien Labbé'': '''Combinatorics on words'''.
        1. Use colors and @interact of sage to study equations on words.
           [http://wiki.sagemath.org/Days9Projects?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Equations_on_words_with_color.sws Equations_on_words_with_color.sws] (Next version of [http://code.google.com/p/sage-words/ sage-words package] needed to run it!!)
        2. Use jyscript and jython to create a java applet to illustrate Christoffel words
           [http://wiki.sagemath.org/Days9Projects?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=ChristoffelWord.py ChristoffelWord.py]
        3. Add gridlines support for show() in sage. Franco Saliola improved *a lot* my initial patch by changing it all (!!) and added many options to make it work like in Matematica. See [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3825 Ticket #3825]

 * ''Michael Lamoureux'': '''EasyBalls'''. A 2D animation of colliding balls, maybe with gravity, maybe with E&M if I can get the 3D in there.

 * ''Jakub Marecek'': '''Toy Integer Programming Solver'''.  A very limited integer programming solver for instances with 3 variables, but complete with several primal heuristics in use today, and visualising the workings nicely. See [http://wiki.sagemath.org/JakubMarecek here] for more.

 * ''Aurel Meyer'': '''Symmetry groups of polytopes'''.  Graphics to illustrate that all symmetry groups of regular polytopes are finite Coxeter groups.

 * ''Zhivko Nedev'': '''Encoding/Representing a class of combinatorial structures and making tools for their visualization and analysis'''. The comb. structure is a MINIMAL edge coloring of K_n, the complete graph, with the following properties:
        1. No two adjacent edges have the same color.
        2. Our coloring splits the set of edges of K_n into color classes; we require that every class has at least two members. 
        3. The coloring is minimal by inclusion. That is, if we delete any subset of vertices  of K_n (and any adjacent edges), then property 2 is violated - there will be at least one color class with one member. 

 * ''Ignacio Rozada'': '''Python and PDE's.''' Solving and plotting numerical solutions to reaction-diffusion partial differential equations on growing domains; a comparison between scipy-matplotlib and matlab.

 * ''Olesya Peshko'': '''Intensity-based Image Segmentation Tool''' A simple segmentation tool which shows regions of the image (represented by a 2D or 3D matrix of pixel/voxel intensity values) in different colours for easy visualization of the structures shown in the image. 

 * ''Drew Chorney": '''Fundamental Domains of Congruence Subgroups and an Animation of a Geodesic :'''Some Geodesic's on the identification space of a fundamental domain for PSL(2,Z) in jyscript. And visualization of fundamental domains for congruence subgroups using SAGE.  

 * ''Véronique Sangin-Gagnon": '''Triangle Hyperbolic Group'''Graphics that show the representation of a hyperbolic group.
