== Getting to the Collegiana/Hotel Deca from Seattle-Tacoma ==

Here are some options to get to the hotels from the airport:

 * [[http://www.yelp.com/biz/a-abc-transportation-seattle#hrid:keLb-JbNNBPNxcvoGUwIOQ/src:search/query:car%20service|A-ABC Transportation]] offers a flat rate ($30-35 typically, before tip) for door-to-door car service. They are a private car service (though they don't have the nicest fleet of cars) and are less expensive than a cab. Call for a reservation.
 * Taxis from the airport cost about $40 (before tip) and can be found by following the signs in the airport.
 * [[http://shuttleexpress.com/seatac-airport/default.aspx|Shuttle Express]] picks up passengers at the inner curb on the third floor of the Airport Garage. Call  to make a reservation.
 * There is a new light-rail service from the airport to downtown Seattle, but you will then need to take a taxi to the house/hotel (about 5 miles north of downtown). This is not a good option unless you want to spend time in downtown Seattle.
