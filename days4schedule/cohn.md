 Henry Cohn:
  - I hate the E.conductor().  I would like conductor(E).

  - Make it so SAGE can open any format file.  MATLAB can do.
    Load a jpeg; fancy demos.

  - Want SAGE to be able to text message you when a
    computation fixes.

  - Databases of math objects:
       - should have 50 times as many
       - easy for random people to submit
       - e.g., I use Magma just for sloane's lattice tables,
         which are built in.
       - refereed: people sign off on a database.
       - personal databases

  - Specific math that should be more developed:
      - Optimization:
         * conj grad
         * newton
         * grad descent

      - Numerical computation of f'(x) in an *intelligent* way.

      - Give easy black boxes for clueless people but well
        labeled boxes for other people.

      - Linear programing:
           * the best free ones are all mediocre,
             so I have to use CPLEX (?).   $10-20K/cpu/year.
           * But we could do exact, arbitrary precision, and double
             precision LP solver that could do tons of comptuations
             with doubles without too much overhead.

      - Semidefinite programming:
           * nothing arbitrary precision available
           * implement a descent but not so super-good arbitrary precision
             would be good.

      - Automorphism groups:
           * nauty.
               But I want edge-labeled graphs!!   It would be tremendously
               useful to deal with edge-labeled (hyper) graphs.

      - Cellular automata:
           * make it easy for someone with no clue to get beautiful
             visualizations of cellular automata.
           * fractals; julia sets

      - Analytic Riemann Surfaces:
           * explicit covering maps in terms of hypergeometric functions
           * Bernard Deconinck (from UW applied math) -- maple code

      - Lesson plans:
           * Publish class-room tested lecture plans that use
             SAGE
           * Get undergrads to make lesson plans.
           * NSF GK-12: UW grad students involved in local community.

      - Publish idealogical articles in off-beat places
           * You don't have to rely on other people; you get to
             easily change things.
           * Students can makes things arbitrarily more complicated.
