= Sage Days 12: San Diego =

Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power  of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.  Sage Days 12 is a mainly developer-oriented workshop for work on the Sage mathematical software system.  It will be held at the [[http://www.calit2.net/|Calit2 Center at UC San Diego]] and is funded by [[http://www.ccrwest.org/|CCR La Jolla]]. 

== Date and Location ==

The workshop will be  held Jan 21-24, 2009 at [[http://www.calit2.net/|Calit2]].

On Jan 21, 2pm - 5pm, there will be three colloquium-style talks aimed at a general audience:
   * 2pm: ''Introduction to Sage'' (William Stein, Univ. of Washington, Project Founder and Director)
   * 3pm: ''The "Killer Apps" in Sage: Cython, Interact, and 3d Graphics'' (Craig Citro, UCLA, Developer)
   * 4pm: ''The Sage Community'' (Michael Abshoff, Dortmund, Sage Release Manager)

== Organization Committee ==

 * Michael Abshoff
 * Martin Albrecht
 * Joe Buhler

 * William Stein

== Goals and Structure ==

The structure of the workshop is as follows: there will be very few lectures, and the rest of the day is spent with intense working
sessions.  This will consist mostly of:
   * Fix bugs in Sage: there are hundreds of known documented bugs in Sage; let's fix them.
   * Write doctests: the coverage score of sage as of Jan 1 2009 is 64.3%; let's get this to 80% by writing about 3400 new doctests

Though a small group will focus on discussing and implementation Jean-Charles Faugere's F5 algorithm for computing Gr√∂bner bases, ''by far the main goal of this workshop'' is '''fixing bugs and writing doctests''', which will uncover numerous additional bugs.
