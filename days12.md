== About ==

Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power  of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.  Sage Days 12 is a mainly developer-oriented workshop for work on the Sage mathematical software system.  It will be held at the [[http://www.calit2.net/|Calit2 Center at UC San Diego]] and is funded by [[http://www.ccrwest.org/|CCR La Jolla]].

== Date and Location ==

The workshop will be  held Jan 21-24, 2009 at [[http://atkinsonhall.calit2.net/|Atkinson Hall (Calit2)]] in Room 4004.  There are [[http://atkinsonhall.calit2.net/directions/|several maps here]].  The best map there is probably [[http://atkinsonhall.calit2.net/directions/pdf/UCSD_map_Calit2.pdf|this one (3MB pdf)]]; our hotel is just below the bottom of that map around 13E.

The probability of this attack to succeed is 

On Jan 21, 2pm - 5pm, there will be three colloquium-style talks aimed at a general audience:
   * 2pm: ''Introduction to Sage'' (William Stein, Univ. of Washington, Project Founder and Director)
   * 3pm: ''The "Killer Apps" in Sage: Cython, Interact, and 3d Graphics'' (Craig Citro, UCLA, Developer)
   * 4pm: ''The Sage Community'' (Michael Abshoff, Dortmund, Sage Release Manager)

We will have a bug triage at 5pm.

== Getting there ==
The conference hotel is ''[[http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lajca-residence-inn-san-diego-la-jolla/|The Residence Inn]] on Gilman, across from UCSD''. 
   * The Cloud 9 Shuttle is probably the most straightforward thing to do --- www.cloud9shuttle.com: "It is possible to make a reservation online, but it's almost always fine to just show up on the sidewalk where all the shuttles show up.   I have dim recollections that there are several stops, depending on where you are going, and that you want one labeled "north" or "north county," and that the price is about $25."  
   * Public transportation (bus): "You can take the 992 from the airport to 4th and Broadway and then take the 30 north to UCSD.  It's like an hour and 45 minutes and $4.50."
   * BETTER Public transportation (bus + trolley): "Danalee likes to ride busses and trolleys.  Here's how she would get to the Gilman Residence Inn from the airport: Take 992 to the transit center at 4th and Broadway.  Take the trolley (either red or blue line) to the Old Town transit center (several stops).  In Old Town, take bus 150 north.  Bus 150 gets on the freeway and takes the Gilman exit, i.e., passes right by the Marriott Residence Inn after a light or two (half a mile?).  This is almost certainly faster than using bus 30, but it does get on the freeway.  Note that the bus web site won't suggest this because it uses the trolley."
   * Rent a car
   * A Taxi -- about $50

== Goals and Structure ==

The structure of the workshop is as follows: there will be very few lectures, and the rest of the day is spent with intense working
sessions.  This will consist mostly of:
   * Fix bugs in Sage: there are hundreds of known documented bugs in Sage; let's fix them.
   * Write doctests: the coverage score of sage as of Jan 1 2009 is 64.3%; let's get this to 80% by writing about 3400 new doctests

Though a small group will focus on discussing and implementation Jean-Charles Faugere's F5 algorithm for computing Gr√∂bner bases, ''by far the main goal of this workshop'' is '''fixing bugs and writing doctests''', which will uncover numerous additional bugs.
