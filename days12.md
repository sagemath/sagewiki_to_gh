= Sage Days 12: San Diego =

Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power  of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.  Sage Days 12 is a mainly developer-oriented workshop for work on the Sage mathematical software system.  It will be held at the [[http://www.calit2.net/|Calit2 Center at UC San Diego]] and is funded by [[http://www.ccrwest.org/|CCR La Jolla]]. 

== Date and Location ==

The workshop will be  held Jan 21-24, 2009 at [[http://www.calit2.net/|Calit2]].

On Jan 21, 2pm - 5pm, there will be three colloquium-style talks aimed at a general audience:
   * 2pm: ''Introduction to Sage'' (William Stein, Univ. of Washington, Project Founder and Director)
   * 3pm: ''The "Killer Apps" in Sage: Cython, Interact, and 3d Graphics'' (Craig Citro, UCLA, Developer)
   * 4pm: ''The Sage Community'' (Michael Abshoff, Dortmund, Sage Release Manager)

== Organization Committee ==

 * Michael Abshoff
 * Martin Albrecht
 * Joe Buhler
 * Craig Citro
 * William Stein

== Schedule ==

 * Coming soon


== Goals and Structure ==

The structure of the workshop is as follows: there will be a few lectures each day and and the rest of the day is spent with intense working
sessions. This will consist mostly of groups working to implement new functionality in Sage, or discussing design decisions for new features. One
of the main goals of this workshop is get many bugs as listed on Sage's bug tracker (http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/) fixed. Of course, every
participant is free to work on whatever he/she feels most productive working on. For instance, a small group will focus on discussing and implementation Jean-Charles Faugere's F5 algorithm for computing Gr√∂bner bases.
