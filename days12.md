== Goals and Structure ==

The structure of the workshop is as follows: there will be a few lectures each day and and the rest of the day is spent with intense working
sessions. This will consist mostly of groups working to implement new functionality in Sage, or discussing design decisions for new features. One
of the main goals of this workshop is get many bugs as listed on Sage's bug tracker (http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/) fixed. Of course, every
participant is free to work on whatever he/she feels most productive working on. For instance, a small group will focus on discussing and implementation Jean-Charles Faugere's F5 algorithm for computing Gr√∂bner bases.
