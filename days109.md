[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops|SageDays]] are gatherings of people interested in SageMath, from newcomers to contributors. Sage Days have been organized as local, regional, or international in-person meetings by a wide range of people around the globe.  Because of the current global health crisis, we organize SageDays 109 as the first fully virtual event in the series.

== About SageMath ==

[[https://www.sagemath.org/|Sage]] is a mature, comprehensive, free (open-source) mathematics software system based on Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License, that integrates computer algebra facilities and general computational packages. 

Sage, first released in 2005, in over a decade of incubation in the  [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs|SageMath distribution, comprising 293 software packages]], has grown its own [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage|library of 1000 Cython and over 4400 Python modules]], ranging from `sage.algebras.*` over `sage.geometry.*` to `sage.tensor.*`, with a total of over 2.2 million lines of code.  

[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.0|SageMath 9.0]], released in January 2020, completed the transition of the Sage library to Python 3.

 * '''Please register (ASAP) if you intend to participate''': https://zulip.sagemath.org/#narrow/stream/126-sd109/topic/Registration.20for.20Global.20Virtual.20SageDays.20109

 * Join our [[https://zulip.sagemath.org/#narrow/stream/126-sd109|zulip #sd109]] messaging stream. This stream drives the SageDays event.  All activities are announced there.

 * '''Video conferencing'''. We will mainly be using a free (open source) software solution for videoconferencing: Discussions and talks will happen via [[https://bigbluebutton.org/|BigBlueButton]] (BBB; see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigBlueButton|Wikipedia page]]; [[https://bigbluebutton.org/open-source-license/|license]]).  We will use the BBB servers at Orsay and/or other French institutions.  For the convenience of presenters, we may also use Zoom or Google Meet.

   * Details, schedule, how to access: will be announced on the Zulip stream.
