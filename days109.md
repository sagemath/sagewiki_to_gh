== About SageMath ==

[[https://www.sagemath.org/|Sage]] is a mature, comprehensive, free (open-source) mathematics software system based on Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License, that integrates computer algebra facilities and general computational packages. 

Sage, first released in 2005, in over a decade of incubation in the  [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs|SageMath distribution, comprising 293 software packages]], has grown its own library of 1000 Cython and over 4400 Python modules, [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage|ranging from sage.algebras.* over sage.geometry.* to sage.tensor.* ], with a total of over 2.2 million lines of code.  [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.0|SageMath 9.0]], released in January 2020, completed the transition of the Sage library to Python 3.

 * Join our [[https://zulip.sagemath.org/#narrow/stream/126-sd109|zulip #sd109]] messaging stream. This stream drives the SageDays event.  All activities are announced there.

 * '''Video conferencing'''. We will be using a free (open source) software solution for videoconferencing: Discussions and talks will happen via [[https://bigbluebutton.org/|BigBlueButton]] (BBB; see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigBlueButton|Wikipedia page]]; [[https://bigbluebutton.org/open-source-license/|license]]).  We will use the BBB servers at Orsay and/or other French institutions.  

   * Details, schedule, how to access: will be announced on the Zulip stream.
