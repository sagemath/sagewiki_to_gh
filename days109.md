= Sage de Printemps / days 109 =

Sage day 109 is a "nettoyage de Printemps" (spring cleaning). The aim is to through the already existing trac ticket and

 * confirm if bug still present on recent development version
 * provide code
 * make reviews

Some of us will gather informally in Bordeaux (possibly making some advertisement for Sage at the university).
