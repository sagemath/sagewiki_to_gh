= Sage de Printemps / days 109 =

Sage day 109 is a "nettoyage de Printemps" (spring cleaning). The aim is to go through the already existing trac tickets and

 * confirm if the bug is still present on recent development versions
 * provide code
 * make reviews

You can attend remotely on [[https://zulip.sagemath.org/|zulip]] and some of us will gather informally in Bordeaux. If you are interested in coming to Bordeaux, contact one of the locals (Sébastien Labbé, Vincent Delecroix or Xavier Caruso).
