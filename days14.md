|| 10:30 - 11:30 || David Eisenbud and Mike Stillman: Doing Algebraic Geometry in Macaulay2 -- an introduction [[attachment:cubicsurface.m2]] and [[attachment:cubicsurface.sws]] ||

||11:00am - 12:00 pm|| William Stein et al.: discussion about mathematical software -- what do you want? [[/what|Questions]] ||
|| 1:30 - 3:00 pm || Mike Hansen, Michael Abshoff: Interactive Sage Tutorial - Developing for Sage (bring your laptop!)||
|| afternoon/evening || projects and discussion by people interested in coding in Evans Hall||
