== Software tools for mathematics ==

This page gives pointers to instructions for '''installing the various software tools'''
that will be used during the
'''[[http://matmor.unam.mx/software-tools-math|Software tools for mathematics]]''' workshop.

Ahead of the workshop, we recommend you take some time to install the following software.

At the very least, please install '''Bash, Git, Python, and a text editor,'''
as those will be used in the first two days.

Let us know if you have any difficulty installing any of the software.

  * Bash, Git, Python, and a text editor
      * See the "Setup" section on the page https://thanyta.github.io/2018-01-22-morelia/
  * GAP
      * See https://www.gap-system.org/Releases/index.html
  * PARI/GP
      * See http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/download.html
  * !SageMath
      * See http://www.sagemath.org/download.html
      (scroll down a bit to see the actual instructions).
  * YAGS
      * See https://github.com/yags/yags#installing-yags
  * Discreture
      * See https://github.com/mraggi/discreture#installation
  * !TeXmacs
    * Official page: http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/download/download.en.html
    * Better instructions provided by Adri√°n:
      * Linux: as Appimage, with dependencies cleared out:
        https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/slowphil:/texmacs-devel/AppImage/texmacs-latest-x86_64.AppImage
        (There are also binaries, but you need to install some dependencies, mainly guile)
      * Windows: the following installer is easier and more robust than the one on the official page:
        https://github.com/slowphil/mingw-w64-texmacs/releases/download/svn10980%2Bextras/TeXmacs_installer-1.99.6.svn10980.extras.exe
      * Macintosh: (The main development of TeXmacs is done on a Mac)
        http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/download/macosx.en.html
      * If possible, also install Maxima:
        Maxima: (This should work very nice in Ubuntu and Mac, and there is a way to make it work in Windows)
        http://maxima.sourceforge.net/download.html
