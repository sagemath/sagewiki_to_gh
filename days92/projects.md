= Projects for "Software tools for mathematics", Jan 2018, Morelia, Mexico =

This is the list of themes and projects for [[days92|Software tools for mathematics]], 22-26 Jan 2018, Morelia, Mexico.

You can add ideas here or send suggestions to the organisers (see [[days92#Contact]]).

== Introductions, presentations, tutorials, demos, install parties ==

Part of this should take the form of a [[https://software-carpentry.org/|Software Carpentry]] training.

  * Bash
  * Git
  * Python

We will also present !CoCalc and Jupyter; depending on the audience, we might insist on

  * !CoCalc - Collaborative calculation in the cloud!
    * !CoCalc for collaboration
    * !CoCalc for teaching
  * Jupyter - notebooks for exploration and reproducible research
    * Jupyter notebooks
    * !JupyterHub
    * !JupyterLab

There will also be presentations of GAP, PARI/GP, SageMath, YAGS

  * Discreture - A modern C++ library for efficiently and easily iterating through common combinatorial objects
  * GAP - Groups, Algorithms, Programming - a System for Computational Discrete Algebra
  * PARI/GP - fast computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves...)
  * !SageMath, the Sage mathematics software system, based on Python and shipping a lot of mathematical free software
  * YAGS - Yet Another Graph System - a GAP package for graph theory

== Mathematical software and databases ==

  * !DiscreteZoo - an atlas of combinatorial structures
  * the `surface_dynamics` package for Sage and its database of "origamis" or square-tiled surfaces

== TeXmacs ==

  * !TeXmacs - typesetting mathematics and more
  * the !TeXmacs plugin for Sage

== Mathematical themes ==

  * graphs
  * groups
  * word morphisms, substitutions, Rauzy fractals
  * flat surfaces
  * polyhedra

== Contributing to mathematical free software ==

  * How to contribute to Sage

== Ways to use and spread free software for mathematics ==

  * !TeXmacs
  * !SageDebianLive
  * !CoCalc
