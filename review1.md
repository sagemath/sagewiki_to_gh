= SAGE Review Day 1 =

The event will take place on '''Tuesday, September 22, 2009''' and officially start at 7 am pacific standard time and go on until people run out of energy.

The goal is take care of every ticket that has [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report/10|"needs review"]] status and either give it a positive review or give specific feedback on the ticket and put it back in the "needs work" queue.  We will also evaluate the [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report/19|"needs rebase"]] tickets.


== Guidelines ==



 * Our base version will be the latest alpha (probably 4.1.2.alpha2)
 * Make sure that whatever you work on has a trac ticket.  For a trac account follow [[TracGuidelines|these]] instructions
 * We'll all be on #sage-devel at irc.freenode.net.  See [[IRC]]

= Participants (with area they would like to work on) =

 1. Jason Grout (graphics, graph theory, linear algebra, notebook)
 1. Minh Van Nguyen --- mvngu: porting packages, basic cryptography, documentation
 1. William Stein: anything
 1. Marshall Hampton: polytopes, followed by the notebook.  I will be time-limited on Tuesday but I'll try to do at least a few.
 1. DanDrake (I can join in starting about 4:00 or 5:00 west coast time, can work on anything)
 1. Rob Beezer: graph generators, linear algebra, LaTeX.  Tuesday is really bad, mostly because I am doing a Sage seminar for students after dinner.  I'll try to do some reviews the next few evenings and be in IRC.  I can come off the bench late on Tuesday with fresh legs.
