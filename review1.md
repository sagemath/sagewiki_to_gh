= SAGE Review Day 1 =

The event will take place on '''Tuesday, September 22, 2009''' and officially start at 7 am pacific standard time and go on until people run out of energy.

The goal is take care of every ticket that has [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report/10|"needs review"]] status and either give it a positive review or give specific feedback on the ticket and put it back in the "needs work" queue.  We will also evaluate the [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report/19|"needs rebase"]] tickets.


== Guidelines ==



 * Our base version will be the latest alpha (probably 4.1.2.alpha2)
 * Make sure that whatever you work on has a trac ticket.  For a trac account follow [[TracGuidelines|these]] instructions
 * We'll all be on #sage-devel at irc.freenode.net.  See [[IRC]]
