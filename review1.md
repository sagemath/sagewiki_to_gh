# SAGE Review Day 1

The event will take place on **Tuesday, September 22, 2009** and officially start at 7 am pacific standard time and go on until people run out of energy. 

The goal is take care of every ticket that has <a class="http" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report/10">"needs review"</a> status and either give it a positive review or give specific feedback on the ticket and put it back in the "needs work" queue.  We will also evaluate the <a class="http" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report/19">"needs rebase"</a> tickets. 


## Guidelines

* Our base version will be the latest alpha (probably 4.1.2.alpha2) 
* Make sure that whatever you work on has a trac ticket.  For a trac account follow <a href="/TracGuidelines">these</a> instructions 
* We'll all be on #sage-devel at irc.freenode.net.  See <a href="/IRC">IRC</a>

1. Marshall Hampton: polytopes, followed by the notebook.  I will be time-limited on Tuesday but I'll try to do at least a few. 
1. <a href="/DanDrake">DanDrake</a> (I can join in starting about 4:00 or 5:00 west coast time, can work on anything) 
1. Rob Beezer: graph generators, linear algebra, LaTeX.  Tuesday is really bad, mostly because I am doing a Sage seminar for students after dinner.  I'll try to do some reviews the next few evenings and be in IRC.  I can come off the bench late on Tuesday with fresh legs.
