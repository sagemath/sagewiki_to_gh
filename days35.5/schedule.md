In general, this will be a working Sage Days, but we may have one or two speakers related to this, perhaps from <a class="http" href="http://rstudio.org/">RStudio</a> or <a class="http" href="http://lurch.sourceforge.net/">Lurch</a>.  It is also likely there will be an informal (optional) introduction to how to contribute to Sage and review, since there will be some newcomers.
