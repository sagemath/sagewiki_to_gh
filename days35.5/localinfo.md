Most of the information below assumes a certain level of funding.  Please contact for more information if you need funding for air or lodging.

== Transportation ==

=== Travel to Boston ===
Most travelers who are not driving will be arriving at [[http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/Pages/Default.aspx|Logan International Airport]] in Boston.  See [[days27/faq|the Sage Days 27 FAQ]] for the rules on airfare (e.g., US carriers only).  It is also possible to get to the Boston area using [[http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=am/am2Station/Station_Page&code=BOS|Amtrak into South Station]].

=== Travel to the North Shore ===
From either South Station or Logan, the most preferred way of getting to the North Shore involves getting to North Station, a major commuter rail hub (see the [[http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/|system map]]; Airport is on the Blue Line, South Station is on the Red Line).  There are regular shuttles from all terminals at Logan to the Airport subway station.  As you can see from the system map, Boston's system (the "T") is old enough that several annoying transfers are necessary, but it works reasonably well.

From there, one would take the outbound Newburyport/Rockport line to Beverly Depot; apparently the Wylie Center will order a cab for you if you call them (see below) when you are getting close.  [[http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=NBRYROCK&direction=O&timing=U&RedisplayTime=Redisplay+Time|This link]] is for the outbound schedule on Sundays.  Every other train goes to Montserrat (a stop one beyond Beverly Depot), which is slightly closer, so you can try for that if it is convenient.

It is also possible to take some local buses in slightly less convoluted ways, especially during normal daytime hours on weekdays (for example, taking an express bus from certain airport terminals to Lynn, then catching the commuter rail there).  If you want to try to find out such an option for you, you may find the [[http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/trip_planner/|Trip Planner]] useful; try the "Plan your trip using Landmarks and Stations" link.  However, this happens to be a very challenging trip to plan using this device.  Google Transit seems to be another very useful device ([[http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&f=d&dirflg=r&hl=en&saddr=logan+airport&daddr=beverly%2C+ma&ttype=dep&date=1%2F8%2F12&time=5%3A00pm|here is a sample]]).

If for some reason using the commuter rail will not work out well for you (especially regarding time of day), don't hesitate to contact the organizers and we may be able to arrange some transportation.  Taxi service from Boston to Beverly is apparently well over $60, so that would be a last resort.

== Lodging ==
Out-of-town participants will be lodged at the [[http://www.wyliecenter.com/|Wylie Center]] in Beverly, Mass.  This oceanside conference center is just a few miles from Gordon College and has a nice wireless-enabled coffee shop which we've been assured is very much open for a group of people to code in after hours.  

For this Sage Days, individual participants will make their own reservations.  
 * ''First'', let the organizers know about your intent to stay at the Wylie Center, so we can keep a headcount and arrange roommates.  
   * We will assume that, insofar possible, we will be reimbursing rooms at the double occupancy rate; if you wish to have your own room, you should plan to be reimbursed only for the double rate ($99 per room).
 * Then contact the Wylie Center.  We are using the single rooms with a comfortable rollaway so that we get double occupancy in them, so that is what should be reserved.  Be sure to mention this, and that the reservation is connected with Gordon College; this should get you a rate of $99 a night for a room.  
   * The toll-free reservation phone is 1-866-333-0859; you may also book online at the website above.  
 * You'll need receipts for reimbursement.

== On-site Internet ==
 * The Wylie Center should have complimentary wifi.
 * On campus, we'll be getting individual IDs for accessing the campus wireless network.  In order to use it, your Mac or Linux ''must'' be up-to-date on all updates, especially security ones, or your computer will not be allowed to access the network.  If you are having trouble, let the organizers know and we'll get you whitelisted.

== Food ==
Our current plan is as follows for board.
 * Breakfast with fruit, pastry/bagel, orange juice, and coffee will be provided each day on campus.
 * Ordinarily other meals are "on your own" at Sage Days, but because it is not particularly easy to get to a place to eat from campus, we will partly subsidize lunch.  Each person will receive a five (5) dollar voucher for lunch, with any balance payable in cash.  
 * Dinner will be at local establishments, subject to desires of the group and transportation, or one could naturally order to the hotel if preferred.
   * [[http://www.gordon.edu/areaguide#GalleryItemText6772|A list of places to eat]].
   * Downtown Beverly, North Beverly, and the malls all have a variety of national fast-food and sit-down chains at various price levels.
   * Why not add someplace promoted by [[http://www.capeannchamber.com/|the Cape Ann Chamber of Commerce]] that strikes your fancy?

== Local Attractions ==
 * Here is [[http://www.gordon.edu/areaguide|Gordon's list]] of area attractions.
 * The history of [[http://salem.org/|Salem, Mass.]] is right around the corner - from pioneers to trials to ships to modern tourism.
