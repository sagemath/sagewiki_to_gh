Most of the information below assumes a certain level of funding.  Please contact for more information if you need funding for air or lodging.

== Air travel ==
Air travel really is not about local info, but most people will want to know about this.  See [[days27/faq|the Sage Days 27 FAQ]] for the rules on airfare (e.g., US carriers only).

== Lodging ==
Out-of-town participants will be lodged at the [[http://www.wyliecenter.com/|Wylie Center]] in Beverly, Mass.  This oceanside conference center is just a few miles from Gordon College and has a nice wireless-enabled coffee shop which we've been assured is very much open for a group of people to code in after hours.  

For this Sage Days, individual participants will make their own reservations.  
 * ''First'', let the organizers know about your intent to stay at the Wylie Center, so we can keep a headcount and arrange roommates.  
   * We will assume that, insofar possible, we will be reimbursing rooms at the double occupancy rate; if you wish to have your own room, you should plan 
 * Then contact the Wylie Center.  Be sure to mention that the reservation is connected with Gordon College; this should get you a rate of $99 a night.  
   * The toll-free reservation phone is 1-866-333-0859; you may also book online at the website above.  
 * You'll need receipts for reimbursement.
