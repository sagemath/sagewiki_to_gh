Most of the information below assumes a certain level of funding.  Please contact for more information if you need funding for air or lodging.

== Air travel ==
Air travel really is not about local info, but most people will want to know about this.  See [[days27/faq|the Sage Days 27 FAQ]] for the rules on airfare (e.g., US carriers only).

== Food ==
Our current plan is as follows for board.
 * Breakfast with fruit, pastry/bagel, orange juice, and coffee will be provided each day on campus.
 * Ordinarily other meals are "on your own" at Sage Days, but because it is not particularly easy to get to a place to eat from campus, we will partly subsidize lunch.  Each person will receive a five (5) dollar voucher for lunch, with any balance payable in cash.  
 * Dinner will be at local establishments, subject to desires of the group and transportation, or one could naturally order to the hotel if preferred.

== Lodging ==
Out-of-town participants will be lodged at the [[http://www.wyliecenter.com/|Wylie Center]] in Beverly, Mass.  This oceanside conference center is just a few miles from Gordon College and has a nice wireless-enabled coffee shop which we've been assured is very much open for a group of people to code in after hours.  

For this Sage Days, individual participants will make their own reservations.  
 * ''First'', let the organizers know about your intent to stay at the Wylie Center, so we can keep a headcount and arrange roommates.  
   * We will assume that, insofar possible, we will be reimbursing rooms at the double occupancy rate; if you wish to have your own room, you should plan to be reimbursed only for the double rate ($99 per room).
 * Then contact the Wylie Center.  We are using the single rooms with a comfortable rollaway so that we get double occupancy in them, so that is what should be reserved.  Be sure to mention this, and that the reservation is connected with Gordon College; this should get you a rate of $99 a night for a room.  
   * The toll-free reservation phone is 1-866-333-0859; you may also book online at the website above.  
 * You'll need receipts for reimbursement.

 * The history of [[http://salem.org/|Salem, Mass.]] is right around the corner - from pioneers to trials to ships to modern tourism.
