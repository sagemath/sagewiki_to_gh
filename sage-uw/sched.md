TITLE: Introduction to Abelian Varieties
TIME: 5-6pm on Monday, October 15, 2007
LOCATION: B027 in the Communications building
SPEAKER: Robert Miller

Abstract: What the heck is an abelian variety? Elliptic curves are
the 1-dimensional abelian varieties.   What are they in general?  Maybe
something like an abelian group and an algebraic variety? A complex
torus is a complex manifold which is diffeomorphic to an n-torus. All
such structures can be obtained as a quotient of CC^n by a lattice,
and this procedure gives us a compact complex manifold. For n=1, this
is an elliptic curve. For n >= 1, any variety structure on a complex
torus must be unique, and Riemann proved that there is such a variety
structure if and only if the torus can be embedded in complex
projective space. More specifically, CC^n/L is an abelian variety if
and only if there is a positive definite Hermitian form whose
imaginary part takes integral values on L.

After defining abelian varieties as above, William Stein will give
an example or two in Sage.
