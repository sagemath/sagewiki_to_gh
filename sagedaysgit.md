= Sage Days: Transitioning to Git =

== March 25-29, 2013, Portland, Oregon ==

The aim of this workshop is to prepare Sage for transitioning to Git. There are three main components for enabling this transition:

 * Prepare the Sage codebase for the new directory layout
 * Create a set of development tools for interfacing with Trac and Git
 * Extend the trac's git functionality to attach branches to tickets

This is '''NOT''' a Sage days to learn about how to develop with Git, hopefully we will have a Sage Days focused on that closer to the switch.
