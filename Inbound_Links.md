There is many a website with a link to SageMath, or a database entry or a webpage about Sage. 

This could be in 

   * an index or a thematic list of software 
   * a list of downstream software from one of our upstream packages 
   * a list of packages for some Linux distribution 
   * a list of upstream software from software using Sage 
This page aims to list some such places, in order to check and update the information there once in a while.
