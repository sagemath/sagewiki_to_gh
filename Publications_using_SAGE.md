== Technical/Scholarly Publications mentioning SAGE ==

If you use SAGE in a book, paper, website, etc., please email me at wstein@gmail.com and reference SAGE as follows:
William Stein, SAGE Mathematics Software (Version 2.7), The SAGE Group, 2007, http://www.sagemath.org/
where you should change 2.7 to the version of SAGE that you used for the paper. In Bibtex:

{{{
@manual{sage,
       Key = {SAGE},
       Author = {William Stein},
       Organization = {The SAGE~Group},
       Title = {{SAGE} {M}athematics {S}oftware ({V}ersion 2.7)},
       note= {{\tt http://www.sagemath.org}},
       Year = 2007}
}}}
Or,
{{{
\bibitem[SAGE]{sage}
Stein, William, \emph{Sage {M}athematics {S}oftware ({V}ersion 2.8.4)}, The
  SAGE~Group, 2007, {\tt http://www.sagemath.org}.
}}}

Also, be sure to find out what components of SAGE, e.g., Numpy, PARI, GAP, that your calculation uses, and properly attribute those systems (for example, ask on sage-devel). Similarly, consider finding out who wrote the SAGE code you're using and acknowledge them explicitly as well.
