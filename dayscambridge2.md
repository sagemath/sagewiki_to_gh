## Organizing Committee

* Craig Citro 
* Kiran Kedlaya 
* Barry Mazur 
* William Stein (chair) 
All sessions are open to the public. Funding is mostly limited to invited participants; however, if you just found out about this meeting and want to participate, contact <a href="/KiranSKedlaya">Kiran Kedlaya</a> and we'll see what we can do. 

On December 5, we also plan to hold the first <a href="/education1">Sage Education Day</a>, coordinated by Karl-Dieter Crisman and Nathan Carter.
