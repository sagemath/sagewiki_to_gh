== Organizing Committee ==
 * Craig Citro
 * Kiran Kedlaya
 * Barry Mazur
 * William Stein (chair)

All sessions are open to the public. Funding is mostly limited to invited participants; however, if you just found out about this meeting and want to participate, contact [[KiranSKedlaya|Kiran Kedlaya]] and we'll see what we can do.
