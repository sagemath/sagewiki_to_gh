== Organizing Committee ==
 * Craig Citro
 * Kiran Kedlaya
 * Barry Mazur
 * William Stein (chair)

The meeting will be open, but funding from CMI will most likely be limited to invited participants. We may have a bit of additional funding through MIT for other participants; contact [[KiranSKedlaya|Kiran Kedlaya]].

On December 5, we also plan to hold the first [[education1|Sage Education Day]], coordinated by Karl-Dieter Crisman.
