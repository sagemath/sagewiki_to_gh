~+Introduction+~

SAGE has many of the capabilities of Mathematica, and many additional ones (e.g. wiki-creating software and a 3D raytracer).  Some features of SAGE have been inspired by Mathematica, but overall the syntax and structure of SAGE are quite different.  One of the main influences on SAGE is the use of the language Python.  

This page is intended to help users familiar with Mathematica migrate to SAGE more easily.
