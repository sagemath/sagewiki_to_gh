Sage is fully supported on the following platforms:

 * Linux on x86
 * Linux on x86-64, i.e. AMD's Athlon 64 & Opteron CPUs and Intel's CPUs with EMT64 extension
 * Linux on IA64
 * Linux on PPC (32 bit only)
 * MacOSX 10.4 and 10.5 on PPC (32 bit only)
 * MacOSX 10.4 and 10.5  on Intel (32 bit only)
 * Solaris 10 on Sparc 32 bit. 
 * VMWare via a 32 bit Linux image (we support a specific preconfigured image meant for use in Windows).

"Supported" means all doctests pass. If not, please report the problem to the Google group [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel|sage-devel]] or [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|sage-support]]. You can also report problems in the IRC channel #sage-devel on [[http://freenode.net|freenode]].
 
The following platforms are feasible in the short term and depend mostly on somebody who is willing to do the job. If you intend to work on a specific port, please let the Sage people know.

 * Solaris 10 on x86 32 bit. (Works 100%, and should be upgraded to fully supported soon).
 * Solaris 10 on SPARC 64 bit. 
 * OpenSolaris on x86 32 bit. (Works 100%, and should be upgraded to fully supported soon).
 * OpenSolaris on x86 64-bit 
 * BSD support on x86, x86-64: most likely FreeBSD
 * Windows/Cygwin: this port is very active. 

The following two platforms are feasible, but not in the short term, as the work involved will be significant. 

 * AIX
 * HP-UX

The status of various ports can be followed in the following places:
