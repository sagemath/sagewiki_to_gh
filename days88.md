= Sage Days 88: Opening Workshop for a Year of Coding Sprints at the IMA =

== General Information ==

Sage Days will kick off a year-long series of open-source software coding sprints at the IMA. This workshop will bring together mathematicians, engineers, educators, members of industry, and researchers from the national labs to discuss, design, and implement new algorithms and computational tools that will be of use to scientists and industry professionals.  All software developed during the workshop will be made freely available as part of the open-source mathematics software system Sage (http://www.sagemath.org).

Themes of the workshop include applied representation theory, optimization, data science, machine learning, algebraic combinatorics, and computational number theory. The workshop will include talks on target features and the logistics of Sage development, including time for design discussions and coding sprints to implement the developed algorithms.

In the ensuing year, workshop participants will be invited to return to the IMA in small groups to push the software development even further in coding sprints.
