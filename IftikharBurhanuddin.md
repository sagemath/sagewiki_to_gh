1. Deciding whether the p-torsion group of the Q_p-rational points of an elliptic curve is non-trivial.
ANTS VI Poster Abstracts. SIGSAM Bulletin, Volume 38, Number 3 September 2004 Issue 149.

Abstract: This note describes an algorithm to decide whether an elliptic curve over Q_p has a non-trivial p-torsion part (# E(Q_p)[p] is not equal to 1) under certain assumptions.

2. Elliptic curve torsion points and division polynomials
Computational Aspects of Algebraic Curves, T. Shaska (Ed.), Lecture Notes Series on Computing, 13 (2005), 13--37, World Scientific.

Abstract: We present two algorithms - p-adic and l-adic - to determine E(Q)_{tors} the group of rational torsion points on an elliptic curve. Another algorithm we introduce is one which decides whether an elliptic curve over Q_p has a non-trivial p-torsion part and this comes into play in the p-adic torsion computation procedure. We also make some remarks about the discriminant of the m-division polynomial of an elliptic curve and the information it reveals about torsion points.

4. On projectively rational lifts of mod $7$ Galois representations, with Luis Dieulefait. JP Journal of Algebra, Number Theory and Applications, Volume 20, Issue 1, 109 -- 119, February 2011.

5. Elliptic curves with large Shafarevich-Tate group

Abstract: We show that there exist infinitely many elliptic curves with Shafarevich-Tate group of order essentially as large as the the square root of the minimal discriminant assuming certain conjectures. This improves on a result of de Weger.
