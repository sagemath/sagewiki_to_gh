The following is a missing piece of documentation for adding new {{{.pyx}}} to the ''Sage'' library: See [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/prog/node40.html 5.2] of the [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/prog/prog.html Sage Programming Guide].

== Writing Optimized Compiled Code with Sage ==
=== Examples ===
==== Creating .pyx Files in the Sage Library ====

Suppose you want a more permanent way of including your optimized Cython code in Sage. Perhaps
you want to contribute to the Sage project? This guide will show you how to create a simple
Cython module and then link it to the Sage library so that your code will appear in future
versions of Sage.

 * Checkout from {{{cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.opentick.com:/var/cvs co otfeed1.1-dev}}} (Note that this currently does not work! Results in following error message:)
   {{{
   cvs [checkout aborted]: connect to cvs.opentick.com(64.210.196.151):2401 failed: No route to host
   }}}
 For now, download from http://cvs.opentick.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/otfeed1.1-dev/otfeed1.1-dev.tar.gz?tarball=1.
 * Download patch from http://otfeed-patches.googlecode.com/files/otfeed1.1-dev-autotools.patch into top-level folder so that compiler can use GNU autotools.
 * Apply patch using the following command:
   {{{
   $ patch -p1 < otfeed1.1-dev-autotools.patch 
     patching file Applications/HistCsv/Include/Makefile.am 
     patching file Applications/HistCsv/Makefile 
     patching file Applications/HistCsv/Makefile.am 
     patching file Applications/HistCsv/Sources/Makefile.am 
     patching file Applications/Makefile.am 
     patching file AUTHORS 
     patching file ChangeLog 
     patching file configure.ac 
     patching file COPYING 
     patching file Include/Makefile.am 
     patching file INSTALL 
     patching file Makefile.am 
     patching file NEWS 
     patching file OTFeed.CPP/Include/Makefile.am 
     patching file OTFeed.CPP/Makefile 
     patching file OTFeed.CPP/Makefile.am 
     patching file OTFeed.CPP/Sources/Makefile.am 
     patching file README 
     patching file Samples/Linux/Makefile 
     patching file Samples/Linux/Makefile.am 
     patching file Samples/Makefile.am
   }}}
 * Bootstrap the autotool build system:
   {{{
   $ autoreconf -i 
     configure.ac:8: installing `./missing' 
     configure.ac:8: installing `./install-sh' 
     Applications/HistCsv/Sources/Makefile.am: installing `./depcomp'
   }}}
 * Configure, make, and install Opentick source in {{{src/}}} to {{{$SAGE_ROOT}}}. Libraries are put into {{{$SAGE_LOCAL/lib}}} and headers into  {{{$SAGE_LOCAL/include}}}:
   {{{
   ./configure --prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL
   make 
   make install
   }}}
 * Make and install C++ binary, otwrapper. Binary is copied to {{{$SAGE_LOCAL/bin}}}
   {{{
   cd otwrapper
   make
   make install
   }}}
