The following is a missing piece of documentation for adding new <tt>.pyx</tt> to the ''Sage'' library: See [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/prog/node40.html 5.2] of the [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/html/prog/prog.html Sage Programming Guide].

== Writing Optimized Compiled Code with Sage ==
=== Examples ===
==== Creating .pyx Files in the Sage Library ====

Suppose you want a more permanent way of including your optimized Cython code in Sage. Perhaps
you want to contribute to the Sage project? This guide will show you how to create a simple
Cython module and then link it to the Sage library so that your code will appear in future
versions of Sage.
