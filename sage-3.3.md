= Sage 3.3 Release Tour =

Sage 3.3 was released on FIXME. For the official, comprehensive release notes, see [[http://www.sagemath.org/src/announce/sage-3.3.txt|sage-3.3.txt]]. In general terms, the following points are some of the foci of this release:

 * Clean up various doctest failures from 3.2.3
 * Fix some build issues from 3.2.3 on the new set of supported images
 * Merge small to medium sized patches ready to go in
 * Switch to [[http://www.mpir.org|eMPIRe]] for multi-precision integers and rationals
 * Switch to [[http://ecls.sourceforge.net|ecl]] for a Common Lisp implementation
 * Update [[http://www.python.org|Python]] to 2.5.4
 * Update [[http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr|Pari]] to 2.3.4svn
 * Switch to [[http://www.flintlib.org|FLINT]] for univariate polynomial arithmetic over {{{Z/nZ}}}

Here's a summary of features in this release, categorized under various headings.

== Algebra ==

 * Transitivity for permutation groups (William Stein) -- In the permutation group module {{{permgroup.py}}}, the query function {{{is_transitive()}}} returns whether or not the group is transitive on {{{[1..G.degree()]}}}. A few surrounding docstrings are fixed and doctest coverage for the file {{{sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py}}} is now 100%.

== Algebraic Geometry ==

 * Improved precision and performance when calculating analytic rank (William Stein) -- When calculating the analytic rank of an elliptic curve, the default is to use Cremona's {{{gp}}} script, where the precision is automatically doubled until it doesn't fail. The precision is started at 16 rather than the previous default precision. The computation is now about 3 times faster usually by starting off using this smaller precision.

== Basic Arithmetic ==

 * {{{ivalue}}} field in {{{integer_mod.pyx}}} is no longer public (Craig Citro) -- The {{{ivalue}}} field for {{{IntegerMod_int}}} is no longer public. This gives about a 1.5 to 2X speedup when multiplying {{{IntegerMod_ints}}}. 

 * Some fixes for {{{is_perfect_power}}} and {{{bessel_J(0,0)}}} (Craig Citro, Robert Bradshaw, Robert Miller) -- A temporary work around for an upstream bug in GMP when using {{{is_perfect_power()}}}. Resolved a Pari interface bug when using {{{bessel_J(0,0)}}}.

 * Improved performance for generic polynomial rings, and for univariate polynomial arithmetic over {{{Z/nZ[x]}}} (Yann Laigle-Chapuy, Martin Albrecht) -- Improved performance when performing modulo arithmetic between elements of a generic polynomial ring. Univariate polynomial arithmetic over {{{Z/nZ[x]}}} now has considerable speed-up at approximately 20x.

== Build ==

 * 64-bit OSX (Michael Abshoff) -- Fixed 64-bit OSX build support for f2c, added 64-bit OSX build support for tachyon, added 64-bit OSX build support for flintqs, and added persistent Sage 64-bit building switch on OSX and Solaris.

== Calculus ==

 * LaTeX output (Mike Hansen) -- Added LaTeX output for ceiling, floor, and derivative functions, and LaTaX'ing of powers of negative numbers.

 * Make {{{bernoulli_polynomial}}} independent of Maxima (Craig Citro) -- A rewrite of {{{bernoulli_polynomial}}} to avoid using Maxima completely in computing Bernoulli polynomials. This gives roughly a factor of 10 speedup.

== Coding Theory ==

 * Weight distribution for binary codes (Robert Miller) -- A weight distribution algorithm for binary codes using Robert Bradshaw's bitsets. This implementation in [[http://www.cython.org|Cython]] gives a 19 to 20 times performance speed-up over the previous GAP/Guava implementation.

== Coercion ==

 * Ring coercion for polynomials over finite fields (William Stein).

 * Move univariate polynomial rings to new coercion model (Robert Bradshaw).

== Combinatorics ==

== Commutative Algebra ==

 * Multivariate polynomials over residue fields of number fields (Nick Alexander) -- Fixed an infinite loop bug when working with multivariate polynomials over residue fields of number fields. Previously in hashing "large" characteristic residue fields, the hash method would try to hash an ideal of the residue field itself, which in turn would try to hash its parent, and so on ad infinitum. At no point has a residue field with cardinality a very large prime been created in Sage.

 * GCD of polynomials over finite fields (Martin Albrecht) -- Previously when using  ibsingular to compute the GCD of two (multivariate) polynomials over finite fields, Sage would segfault whenever the base rings are not identical.

 * Deprecate {{{Ideal.reduced_basis}}} (John Perry) -- The previous name {{{Ideal.reduced_basis}}} is misleading as it suggests that it can be used for computing the reduced Gr√∂bner basis, when in fact it returns the interreduced basis. Thus {{{Ideal.reduced_basis()}}} is now deprecated and users are encouraged to use {{{Ideal.interreduced_basis()}}} instead.

== Distribution ==

 * GAP configuration file (Matthias Meulien) -- A user's local GAP configuration file is usually named {{{$HOME/.gaprc}}}. When such a file already exists and Sage is compiled from source, using the Sage interface to GAP, e.g. {{{gap._eval_line('1+3;')}}}, can result in gibberish. This is now fixed so that the GAP interface would output a comprehensible message/answer as a result of some GAP calculation.
