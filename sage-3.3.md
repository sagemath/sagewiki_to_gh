Sage 3.3 was released on FIXME. For the official, comprehensive release notes, see [[http://www.sagemath.org/src/announce/sage-3.3.txt|sage-3.3.txt]]. In general terms, the following points are some of the foci of this release:

 * Clean up various doctest failures from 3.2.3
 * Fix some build issues from 3.2.3 on the new set of supported images
 * Merge small to medium sized patches ready to go in
 * Switch to eMPIRe
 * Switch to ecl
 * Update Python to 2.5.4
 * Ppdate Pari to 2.3.4svn

Here's a summary of features in this release, categorized under various headings.

 * Transitivity for permutation groups (William Stein) -- In the permutation group module {{{permgroup.py}}}, the query function {{{is_transitive()}}} returns whether or not the group is transitive on {{{[1..G.degree()]}}}. A few surrounding docstrings are fixed and doctest coverage for the file {{{sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py}}} is now 100%.
