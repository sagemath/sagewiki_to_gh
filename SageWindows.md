As of SageMath 8.0 a native Windows binary installer is available for 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and up.  The latest releases of the Windows installer can be found [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/releases|here]].  Most users will find this to be better-integrated with their native system than the old [[SageAppliance|VirtualBox appliance]]; however, the appliance is still available for those who prefer it.
