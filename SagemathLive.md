We use here ubuntu. The use of debian is the same, but we do not make debian sagemath images.
If you are using another debian (Knoppix...) and you have a debian sagemath version, it is very similiar.

== What you need ==

 * bootable CD or USB-stick with ubuntu 
 * usb-stick,sd card... to put the sagemath image file on it
 * internet connection (or the deb-files you need for sagemath gfortran...)

 1. get root rights:
   * type: '''sudo bash''' and press Return
 1. install the packages you need
   * type: '''apt-get install gfortran''' and press Return
 1. finde the path to the sagemath image file 
   * open natilus (file manager)
