= Sage Days 3 Proposed Talks/Speakers =

 * [:MartinAlbrecht: Martin Albrecht]
 * Nick Alexander
 * Gregory Bard -- "The Method of Four Russians for Matrix Inverses and Factorization"
 * [:TomBoothby: Tom Boothby]
 * [:IftikharBurhanuddin: Iftikhar Burhanuddin] -- I could speak on the SupersingularModule during SD3. My plan is to speed up some of the internals between now and SD3, run computation, and give an update on what has happened since august --- msri06, the summer grad workshop on computing with modular forms.

Can someone volunteer to discuss some of the issues about parallelism that arose at the recent workshop on interactive parallel computation? Specifically stuff that is relevant to SAGE?
