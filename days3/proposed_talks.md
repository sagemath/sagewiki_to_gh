* <a href="/MartinAlbrecht">Martin Albrecht</a> 
* Gregory Bard -- "The Method of Four Russians for Matrix Inverses and Factorization" 
* <a href="/IftikharBurhanuddin">Iftikhar Burhanuddin</a> -- I could speak on the <a href="/SupersingularModule">SupersingularModule</a> during SD3. My plan is to speed up some of the internals between now and SD3, run computation, and give an update on what has happened since august --- msri06, the summer grad workshop on computing with modular forms. 
* <a href="/DavidHarvey">David Harvey</a> 
* SJ Klein -- OLPC 
* Sebastian Pauli -- Round 4 algorithm for factoring polynomials over local fields 
* David Roe -- p-adic Arithmetic in SAGE 
* Suvrit Sra -- Numerical Linear Algebra/Matrix Computation 
* <a href="/WilliamStein">WilliamStein</a> William Stein 
* <a href="/YiQiang">Yi Qiang</a> -- Distributed SAGE 
Can someone volunteer to discuss some of the issues about parallelism that arose at the recent workshop on interactive parallel computation? Specifically stuff that is relevant to SAGE?
