== Planned schedule ==
 
 * Sat: Talks from 9-12, optional talks from 2-5
 * Sun: Talks from 9-12, optional talks from 2-5
 * Mon & Tues: Coding sprints, a colloquium talk
 * Weds: Talks & wrap-up all day
 
Talks that everyone cares  
about will be in the mornings, and in the afternoons, we'll have more  
specialized talks by the same speakers. In the afternoons, we may  
also try to organize various tutorials for those not interested in  
the specialized talks. Also, the goal is to try to give something of  
a theme to each of the two days. We'll have slightly fewer talks than  
the last SAGE Days.
 
The first day will be targeted to people who are not experts on SAGE,  
which for our purposes, might mean anyone who isn't a SAGE Developer,  
but might like to be. An example of this might be a "State of the  
Union" talk by William in the morning, and a talk on what an  
undergraduate can do to get involved with SAGE in the afternoon. If  
anyone has ideas for good coding projects that undergraduates can get  
involved with, let us know. 

The second day will be targeted at SAGE Developers. The morning will  
be talks about things that everyone needs to hear about, and the  
afternoon talks will be talks about more specified topics that people  
might be interested in. So, using SD2 for examples again, we'd have  
David Harvey's talk on SAGE Architecture, and in the afternoon,  
Martin Albrecht's talk on F4.
