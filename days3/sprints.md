= Sage Days 3 Coding Sprints =

List your ideas for coding sprints here.

 1. Josh Kantor: Sparse numerical linear algebra

 * Tom Boothby: [http://cr.yp.to/papers/pippenger.pdf Pippenger's Algorithm] for multivariate polynomial evaluation

 * William Stein: Optimized exact sparse and dense linear algebra (especially for computing modular forms)

 * David Harvey (+ possibly Martin Albrecht): multithreaded polynomial arithmetic in FLINT

 * David Roe: p-adics (extension fields)

 * Tom Boothby: 3d object arithmetic / integration with tachyon

== NOTE ==

It would be very good to do the following for each sprint project:
    a) create a specific detailed realistic list of goals.
    b) list every possible problem they can think of that might cause problems for (a)
    c) how many people are needed to do a)
    d) background reading material that sprinters should look at (this could be papers or source code).
    e) anything else that could go wrong, and ways to deal with it.
