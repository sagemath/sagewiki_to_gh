= Lightning Talks Ideas/Suggestions =
 * Gregory Bard -- Equations I'd really like someone to solve. Please!!!
 * Martin Albrecht -- linking against Singular and fast commutative algebra in SAGE
 * Bobby Moretti -- calculus demo/discussion [[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/moretti/days3/talks/calculus.pdf|slides]]
 * Nick Alexander -- a very small SageX example, hopefully to complement Martin's talk.  I see now that Martin's talk is later, in the developer section, so maybe this should wait?
 * Gregory Bard -- A totally impractical algorithm for matrix multiplication in time $\Theta(\frac{n^w}{(\log n)^{(w/2)}})$ for any 3<omega<2.
