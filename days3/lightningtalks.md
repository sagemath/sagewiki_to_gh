# Lightning Talks Ideas/Suggestions

* Gregory Bard -- Equations I'd really like someone to solve. Please!!! 
* Martin Albrecht -- linking against Singular and fast commutative algebra in SAGE 
* Bobby Moretti -- calculus demo/discussion <a class="http" href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/moretti/days3/talks/calculus.pdf">slides</a> 
* Nick Alexander -- a very small SageX example, hopefully to complement Martin's talk.  I see now that Martin's talk is later, in the developer section, so maybe this should wait? 
* Gregory Bard -- A totally impractical algorithm for matrix multiplication in time $\Theta(\frac{n<sup>w}{(\log n)</sup>{(w/2)}})$ for any 3<omega<2.
