= Tom Boothby: Implement Pippenger's Algorithm for multivariate polynomial evaluation =

[http://cr.yp.to/papers/pippenger.pdf Paper]


Skip to page 13.  I've already implemented:

 * Direct computation (option 1 in the paper)
 * Input partitioning (option 2)
 * Most of input clumping (option 3)

I need:
 * Output partitioning
 * Output clumping
 * Some insight as to why DJB thinks that one can "quickly compute the parameter sequence given ''p, q''.  I'll bring a print copy of the 3 papers by Pippenger.
 * The general case (not certain this is a reasonable goal for the amount of time we have)
