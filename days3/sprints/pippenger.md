= Tom Boothby: Implement Pippenger's Algorithm for multivariate polynomial evaluation =

Pippenger's Algorithm is a method to compute a sequence of multiple products of multiple inputs.  I intend to use this to (drastically, in some cases) speed up the evaluation of multivariate polynomials over arbitrary rings.

[http://cr.yp.to/papers/pippenger.pdf Paper]

[http://sage.math.washington.edu/sprint/pippenger.sws Worksheet] with my progress so far.

Skip to page 13.  I've already implemented:

 * Direct computation (option 1 in the paper)
 * Input partitioning (option 2)
 * Most of input clumping (option 3)

I need:
 * Output partitioning (option 4)
 * Output clumping (excercise left to reader)
 * Some insight as to why DJB thinks that one can "quickly compute the parameter sequence given ''p, q''.  I'll bring a print copy of the 3 cites from Pippenger [34-36].
 * The general case (not certain this is a reasonable goal for the amount of time we have)
