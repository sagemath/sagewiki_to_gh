# Josh Kantor: Sparse numerical linear algebra

I would like to implement a sparse matrix class that has the capability to solve Sparse systems using the library SuperLU. I have an spkg that installs SuperLU into the sage libraries

For more info on SuperLU look at

I am interested in other capabilities (eigenvalues in particular, I would like to work on sparse solvers first.)
