You should try to create a coding sprint project out of this for SAGE Days 3:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/days3/sprints

The memory leak might just be the result of caching in the ssmod.py module...
You would do well to think through precisely what
          X = SupersingularModule(p)
          X.hecke_matrix(2)
does.  The get_memory_usage() command can be very useful also for seeing
when memory is going up but not down.

Perhaps related (and maybe already fixed). But I noticed the
following
do
M=MatrixSpace(ZZ,1000)

then repeatedly do
m=M.random_element();get_memory_usage()

You should see the memory usage go up by around 16 mb per execution
and it doesn't appear to ever go down,

If you do the same thing with RDF matrices for example, the memory
usage goes up a bit but remains basically constant.
