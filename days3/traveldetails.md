= SAGE Days 3 Travel Info =

 * Wherever you're flying from, you want to fly into LAX, and take transportation from there. Probably the easiest way to get from the airport to the hotel is to take the Super Shuttle; if you're familiar with LA, you may want to catch the Santa Monica Bus #3 for $.75 at the airport.

 * Hotel info: We've reserved a block of rooms at the Westwood on Wilshire Hotel, with a reduced rate. The intention is as follows: undergrads, grad students, and willing postdocs should try to share a room, and more senior people uninterested in sharing a room should book a room by themselves. Make sure to mention IPAM when making your reservation. If you need to find someone to share a room with, send out a message on sage-devel (which is probably the wrong list for this, but is the most likely to get you a quick answer). All the details are on the IPAM page, including phone number and whatnot. 

 * Weather: The weather in February in LA is much like the weather in LA all year: 70 degrees and sunny. It will probably cool off in the evenings, so be prepared with a jacket or sweater. You should check weather.com or a similar source closer to the conference; 
[http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/90095?from=36hr_fcst10DayLink_undeclared here] is a quick link for the next 10 days on campus.

 * The hotel is a brisk 15 minute walk from IPAM, and there's also a shuttle that runs back and forth (though I'm not yet sure about the situation on weekends).
