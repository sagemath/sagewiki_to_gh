I use Sage mainly for teaching, at [[http://verso.mat.uam.es/web/|Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid]]. I've given talks introducing Sage a few times, and I've also given talks about mathematics to a general audience using Sage (about RSA and juggling). I heartly recommend using a live notebook instead of a static presentation whenever possible. You can find those presentations, and some other Sage-related material in the section 'Docencia' in [[http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/ciencias/pangulo/|my website]].
