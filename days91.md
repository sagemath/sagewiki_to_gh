Please add "sd91" as a keyword to any tickets you are working on during this week so they show up in this list: [[https://trac.sagemath.org/query?keywords=~sd91&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=status|sd91 Tickets]]

'''Lattice related projects'''
  * fix vector matrix multiplication for free module elements [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23576|#23576]]
  * fix .annihilator() for the trivial abelian group [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22720|#22720]]
  * fix intersections of free_quadratic_modules and thus homomorphisms of abelian groups [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23703|#23703]]
  * implement finite bilinear/quadratic forms and make sure that the discriminant group has one [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23699|#23699]]
  * implement QQ/ZZ , QQ/2ZZ or QQ/nZZ as abelian groups. This is where finite quadratic/bilinear forms have values
  * implement a class for (subgroups of) the orthogonal group of a finite bilinear/quadratic form and an algorithm to compute it
  * diagonalization and isomorphism testing for finite quadratic/bilinear forms
  * create a genus from a signature pair and a finite quadratic form
  * create a finite quadratic form from a genus
  * a latex representation for the genus using the Conway Sloane genus symbols
  * a base class for the orthogonal group of a lattice
  * a method to compute the orthogonal group of a positive definite lattice

'''Point counting and zeta function projects'''
  * hypergeometric motives [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23671|#23671]]
  * get Edgar Costa's code for zeta functions of projective hypersurfaces into Sage [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23863|#23863]]

== Tickets needing review ==

  * a class for integral lattices [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23634|#23634]]

  * bugfix for genera equality testing [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23376|#23376]]

== To prepare for the workshop ==

Before the workshop, we recommend [[http://www.sagemath.org/|downloading and installing]] the latest version of the source code of Sage, opening a [[https://trac.sagemath.org/|Sage trac]] account.
