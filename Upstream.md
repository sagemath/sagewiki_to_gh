== Upstream projects ==

  * Components: http://www.sagemath.org/links-components.html
  * Used for the infrastructure:
    * [[https://trac.edgewall.org|Trac]]
    * [[https://askbot.com|Askbot]]
    * [[https://groups.google.com/|Google groups]]
    * [[https://github.com/|GitHub]]
    * [[https://moinmo.in|MoinMoin]]

== Upgrading and updating upstream packages ==

  * The Fedora people have a useful tool to track upstream version changes: https://release-monitoring.org/

== Sage trac tickets about upgrades, updates, packages ==

Here are some useful trac queries (final "e" omitted on purpose to also get final "ing").

  * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/query?summary=~upgrad&desc=1&order=status|summary contains upgrad]]
  * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/query?summary=~updat&desc=1&order=status|summary contains updat]]
  * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/query?summary=~upgrad&or&summary=~updat&desc=1&order=status|summary contains upgrad or updat]]
  * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/query?summary=~packag&desc=1&order=status|summary contains packag]]
  * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/query?summary=~upgrad&or&summary=~updat&or&summary=~packag&desc=1&order=status|summary contains "upgrad" or "updat" or "packag"]]
