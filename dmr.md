I am working on a notebook version of the SAGE Documentation. So far I have a navigable and evaluatable doc browser that can be launched from a sage notebook. The doc browser grabs a doc page (initially index.html) from devel/doc-1.4/html/ directory and seperates the textual content from the example sage code, all of which become cells in a special 'doc browser' worksheet.

Things in question:

  '''Other things:'''[[BR]] wiki-formated output of a sage notebook (a built in notebook function).[[BR]]

 * ["dmr/notebookwiki"]: notebook wiki
 * [:dmr/example:examples]
