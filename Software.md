== Ideas for Software to Integrate with SAGE ==

This is a list of programs and packages for mathematics that might possibly be included with or at least have an interface with SAGE someday. 

 * [http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~hpeyrl/Projects/SOS/rational_sos.php Sums of Squares via Macaulay2]. This is related to http://www.cds.caltech.edu/sostools/

 * http://www.4ti2.de/ --  A software package for algebraic, geometric and combinatorial problems
on linear spaces; I (=william) have made optional SAGE packages for this and written a very preliminary interface.  This depends on a linear programming package, which SAGE needs.

 * http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/ -- Linear programming.  It's 1MB, and very easy to build.
