sage-combinat is a collection of experimental patches
(i.e. extensions) on top of sage, developed by
a community in algebraic combinatorics. Its main purpose is to improve
sage as an extensible toolbox for computer exploration, and foster
code sharing between researchers in this area. The intent is that most
of those patches eventually will get integrated into sage as soon as
they are mature enough, with a typical short life-cycle of a few
weeks.

Most likely, sage-combinat will become the natural successor of [http://mupad-combinat.sf.net|MuPAD-Combinat].
See in particular [http://mupad-combinat.sf.net/Wiki/Sage]

The collection of patches is managed using a patch server (mercurial
queues). Although an occasional contributor can simply send such a
patch to the sage-combinat mailing list [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel] anyone contributing
regularly should use the patch server. Some detailed instructions about the patch server are at [http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/Mercurial].
