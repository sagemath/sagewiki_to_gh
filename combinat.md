= Sage-combinat =

Sage-combinat is a collection of experimental patches
(i.e. extensions) on top of [http://www.sagemath.org/ Sage], developed by
a community in algebraic combinatorics. Its main purpose is to improve
Sage as an extensible toolbox for computer exploration, and foster
code sharing between researchers in this area. The intent is that most
of those patches eventually will get integrated into sage as soon as
they are mature enough, with a typical short life-cycle of a few
weeks. In other words: just install Sage, and you will benefit from
all the Sage-combinat development, except for the latest bleeding edge features.

=== NEWS: 2008-06-19: MuPAD-Combinat join forces with Sage ===

Sage-combinat was born as a partial port of [http://mupad-combinat.sf.net MuPAD-Combinat].
After months of discussions and experiments, an enthusiastic consensus emerged in the
MuPAD-Combinat community to join Sage. Sage-combinat henceforth became
the natural successor of MuPAD-Combinat.

The transition is going to be a massive investment: seven years of
hard work to port over! However a lot of experience was gained since 2000, and
most of the design is now pretty clear. By sharing the work the transition will hopefuly
be relatively quick.

See the [http:/combinat/RoadMap road map and current status] of the port.
