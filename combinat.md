= Sage-Combinat: enhancing Sage as a toolbox for computer exploration in algebraic combinatorics =

Sage-Combinat is a software project whose mission is: '''to improve the open source mathematical system [[http://www.sagemath.org/|Sage]] as an extensible toolbox for computer exploration in (algebraic) combinatorics, and foster code sharing between researchers in this area'''.

In practice, Sage-combinat is a collection of branches on top of [[http://www.sagemath.org/|Sage]], developed by a community of researchers. The intent is that most of those branches get eventually integrated into Sage as soon as they are mature enough, with a typical short life-cycle of a few weeks. In other words: just install Sage, and you will benefit from all the Sage-combinat development, except for the latest bleeding edge features.

 * 2008-06-19: MuPAD-Combinat join forces with Sage

    Sage-combinat was born as a partial port of [[http://mupad-combinat.sf.net|MuPAD-Combinat]]. After months of discussions and experiments, an enthusiastic consensus emerged in the MuPAD-Combinat community to join Sage. Sage-combinat henceforth became the natural successor of {{{MuPAD-Combinat}}}.

   The transition was a massive investment (and is not yet completely
   over): seven years of hard work to port over! However a lot of
   experience was gained since 2000, and most of the design was pretty
   clear, and we could *share* the work.

=== Code ===

The Sage-Combinat extensions used to be managed as a collection of
patches on our [[http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/|patch server]],
using a so-called mercurial queue. Since Sage 6.0, the
[[http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/QuickStartSageGit|development workflow]]
has been reworked in depth, and we are in the progress of migrating
the extensions as git branches.

Quite some stuff below is thus outdated, and will be progressively
replaced by information on the new workflow.
