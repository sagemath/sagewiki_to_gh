= Workshop on Elliptic Curves and Computation =

Oct 18-22, 2010 at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington, USA

The study of Elliptic Curves has been closely connected with machine
computation almost since the invention of computers -- in 1952 Emil
Artin had John von Neumann perform an extensive calculation relating
to elliptic curves on the IAS MANIAC computer. The fundamental papers
of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer in 1965, which gave rise to the
Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture were buttressed with extensive
machine computation starting in 1958. There has been extensive
interplay between theory and computation relating to ranks of elliptic
curves, Heegner points, Galois representations, Sato-Tate
distributions, modular forms and many other areas.

The year 1985 marks the beginning of a 25 year period in which a
number of influential papers initiated a fundamental connection
between elliptic curves, cryptology and the theory of computation.

 * Rene Schoof about fast algorithms for counting points on elliptic curves over finite fields

 * Hendrik Lenstra about integer factorization using elliptic curves

 * Victor Miller and Neal Koblitz about the security of using elliptic Curves over finite fields in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange

 * Shafi G0ldwasser and Joe Kilian about primality proving using elliptic curves

 * Len Adleman and Ming-Deh Huang about primality proving using abelian varieties

 * Oliver Atkin and Francois Morain about primality proving using elliptic curves

Since 1997 there has been an annual workshop on Elliptic Curve
Cryptography. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the above papers we
will hold a full week meeting intermixing talks which are concerned
with the applications of elliptic curves in cryptography and other
fundamental results concerning elliptic curves and computation.

The meeting will be held from Oct 18-22, 2010 at Microsoft Research in
Redmond, Washington, USA.

The organizers are

 * Victor Miller (Center for Communications Research),
 * William Stein and Neal Koblitz (University of Washington), and
 * Kristin Lauter (Microsoft Research)
