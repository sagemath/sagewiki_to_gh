= Discussion: Sage, Macaulay 2, and other Mathematical Software for Algebraic Geometry =

== What are the absolutely critical features that you '''must''' have in the mathematical software you use for '''your''' research? (E.g., fast linear algebra, Groebner basis, sheaves?) ==
 * modular forms
 * fast R[x_1,...,x_n], also with fractional exponents
 * GB's, flexible gradings, term orders
 * rings (not necessarily commutative)
 * modules (not just ideals, not just free)
 * sheaves
 * homological algebra (free resolutions)
 * linear algebra with basis an arbitrary index set I
 * fast sparse and dense linear algebra over finite fields

== What are the '''killer features''' that your dream mathematical software would have? (e.g., good mailing list, free, super fast algorithm for XXX, latex output?) ==
 * (huge) polyhedral geometry (not just polymake, see more below)
 * representation theory for finite groups (char 0 and modular, not just GAP, compare to what MAGMA can do -- and how fast it can do it)
 * rings of representations (Grothendieck rings, etc.)
 * local rings and global rings: localization, really working (not just M2)
 * GB over all rings (e.g. field extensions), even noncommutative when possible
 * full functoriality (e.g. preservation of GL_n-actions, functors, operations on functors, Yoneda product, tensor products)
 * full homological algebra (spectral sequences, derived categories, etc.)
 * parallelize everything
 * deformation theory
 * a "good clean" programming language (not just M2, e.g. Maple -- having to put things into rings before being able to use them is annoying; work easily with general expressions)
 * super fast GB's and syzygies (speed and low memory usage)
 * super fast and low memoryprimary decomposition (e.g. numerical) and integral closure
 * sheaves, Chern classes, intersection theory on singular spaces
 * algebraic topology on complex and real points on a variety
 * etale cohomology
 * usable resolution of singularities

==== Polytopes ====
 * packages: lrs, cddlib, porta, 4ti2, polymake, coin/or
 * optimal performance: important algorithms are reverse search (as in lrs, uses less memory), double description (track the duals, as in cdd and 4ti2)
 * optimization: linear and integer programming (coin/or), semidefinite programming (any good software for this?)
 * combinatorial aspects
 * polymake puts a lot of these things together, but it does not build!

==== Linear algebra ====
 * for a lot of the above issues, we need very very fast linear algebra over a huge range of fields/rings

== What are some things that disturb you about the direction in which Sage is going?  (E.g., too big/ambitious? not open enough or too open?  too many bugs?  changing too quickly? referee process for code inclusion too onerous?) ==
 * developer \neq user => lameness  (e.g. gfan, polyhedral code)
 * language, "relations", US-ification, Sage taking over the universe of free math software is dangerous, respect for other math software
 * bugginess in core algebraic geometry code: not up to snuff, cannot trust the answers now, need to first fix the basics before implementing new stuff
 * third party code currently not refereed: how do we know it's reliable?
 * credit: young people, publication record
 * longterm survivability
 * keeping large scale vision, consistency among various development efforts/packages: categories, generic algorithms and info, learn from Axiom and MuPAD-combinat
 * more documentation: to improve consistency, explain options to user (there can be 25 different algorithms for doing one thing)
 * track usage

== What are some things that disturb you about the direction in which Macaulay2 is going?  (similar e.g. as above) ==
 * all of the above
 * very few developers (solution: M2 days, packages, journal)
 * documentation and tutorial issues (improving)
 * community building lacking
 * uncertainty of long-term funding (only NSF, fickle)
 * todo list needs to be upgraded (just text files in svn repository now)
 * webpage needs to be upgraded
 * narrow scope restricts number of developers (only commutative algebraists and algebraic geometers can contribute, and the intersection between this set and the set of software engineers/programmers is too small)
 * narrow scope restricts users (e.g. lack of group theory functionality makes some algebraic geometers have to use a different system for their research)
