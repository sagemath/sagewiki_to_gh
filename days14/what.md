= Discussion: Sage, Macaulay 2, and other Mathematical Software for Algebraic Geometry =

== What are the absolutely critical features that you '''must''' have in the mathematical software you use for '''your''' research? (E.g., fast linear algebra, Groebner basis, sheaves?) ==
 * modular forms
 * fast R[x_1,...,x_n], and f^(1/n)
 * GB's, free resolutions, flexible gradings, term orders
 * rings (not necessarily commutative)
 * modules (not just ideals, not just free)
 * homological algebra
 * linear algebra with basis an arbitrary index set I
 * fast sparse and dense linear algebra over GF(q)

== What are the '''killer features''' that your dream mathematical software would have? (e.g., good mailing list, free, super fast algorithm for XXX, latex output?) ==
 
== What are some things that disturb you about the direction in which Sage is going?  (E.g., too big/ambitious? not open enough or too open?  too many bugs?  changing too quickly? referee process for code inclusion too onerous?) ==

== What are some things that disturb you about the direction in which Macaulay2 is going?  (similar e.g. as above) ==
