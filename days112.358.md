 * '''Beginning: Wednesday, June 1, 2022, 10:00:00 (morning) GMT''',

   .... which is June 2, 2022, 00:00 Kiribati time (UTC+14),

 * '''End: Friday, June 3, 2022, 11:59:59 (noon) GMT''',

The schedule will be released soon.

[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops|Sage Days]] are gatherings of people interested in !SageMath, from newcomers to contributors. Sage Days have been organized as local, regional, or international in-person meetings by a wide range of people around the globe.  Because of the ongoing global health crisis, Sage Days 112.358 will be a fully virtual event following the model of [[days109|Sage Days 109]] and [[days110|Sage Days 110]]

== About SageMath ==

[[https://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]], or Sage for short, is a mature, comprehensive, free (open-source) mathematics software system based on Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License, that integrates computer algebra facilities and general computational packages. 

Sage, first released in 2005, in over a decade of incubation in the  [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs|SageMath distribution, comprising 293 software packages]], has grown its own [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage|library of 1000 Cython and over 4400 Python modules]], ranging from `sage.algebras.*` over `sage.geometry.*` to `sage.tensor.*`, with a total of over 2.2 million lines of code.  

== How to register and participate ==

 * '''Registration''': Post a message with your name and affiliation in our [[https://sagemath.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/321245-sd112.2E358/topic/Registration|zulip #sd112.358 Registration topic]].

 * Join our [[https://sagemath.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/321245-sd112.2E358|zulip #sd112.358]] messaging stream. This stream will contain all of the information regarding the talks and events for Sage Days 112.358.

 * '''Video conferencing''': We will primarily be using Zoom and [[https://bigbluebutton.org/|BigBlueButton]] (BBB; see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigBlueButton|Wikipedia page]]; [[https://bigbluebutton.org/open-source-license/|license]]) (with BBB servers at Orsay and/or other French institutions). However, other software such as Google Meet can also be used.

   * Details, how to access: will be announced on the Zulip stream.

 * '''[[https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/people/a-z?person=47|Julian Hall]]: HiGHS: The world's best open-source linear optimization software - coming to !SageMath!''' HiGHS is open-source linear optimization software developed by Hall and Edinburgh PhD students over the past six years. It solves large-scale sparse linear programming (LP) problems (using simplex and interior point methods), mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems and quadratic programming (QP) problems. Its overall performance on Mittelmann's benchmarks places it clearly ahead of any other open-source linear optimization software. This talk will introduce some of the techniques underpinning HiGHS, the environment in which it can be used, and its performance. In the world of software interfaces, HiGHS provides the LP and MIP solvers in the !SciPy system, and is the open-source solver of choice in the popular modern Julia-based modelling and optimization system JuMP. The prospects for its integration into !SageMath will be discussed.

 * '''[[https://github.com/mkoeppe/|Matthias Köppe]]: The way to a fully modularized Sage library 10.0.''' In May 2020, I proposed to modularize the Sage library by means of PEP 420 native namespace packages. I will give an overview of the status of this project 2 years and [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29705|200 Trac tickets]] later, and give a roadmap to the completion of the project as the proposed milestone goal for Sage 10.0.

 * '''[[https://github.com/ninamiolane|Nina Miolane]]: Geomstats - a Python package for differential geometry in statistics and machine learning.''' We introduce Geomstats, an open-source Python package for computations and statistics on nonlinear manifolds that appear in machine learning applications, such as: hyperbolic spaces, spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices, Lie groups of transformations, and many more. We provide object-oriented and extensively unit-tested implementations. Manifolds come equipped with families of Riemannian metrics with associated exponential and logarithmic maps, geodesics, and parallel transport. Statistics and learning algorithms provide methods for estimation, clustering, and dimension reduction on manifolds. All associated operations provide support for different execution backends --- namely !NumPy, Autograd, !PyTorch, and !TensorFlow. This talk presents the package, compares it with related libraries, and provides relevant examples. We show that Geomstats provides reliable building blocks to both foster research in differential geometry and statistics and democratize the use of (Riemannian) geometry in statistics and machine learning. The source code is freely available under the MIT license at https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats.
