= Global Virtual Sage Days 112.358 =

An event for the !SageMath user and developer community

Talks will take place June 1-3, 2022, in various time zones. The schedule will be released soon.

[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops|SageDays]] are gatherings of people interested in !SageMath, from newcomers to contributors. Sage Days have been organized as local, regional, or international in-person meetings by a wide range of people around the globe.  Because of the ongoing global health crisis, Sage Days 112.358 will be a fully virtual event following the model of [[days109|Sage Days 109]] and [[days109|Sage Days 110]]
