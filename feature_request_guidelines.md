Feature request guidelines
==========================

This pages suggests a couple questions to ask oneself to formulate
useful and realistic Sage projects.

- Feature name?
  E.g. How to calculate ...

- Specific use cases?

  In our research project, we need to ...

- Sage would be session:

  {{{
    sage: ... the desired input ...
    ... the desired output ...
  }}}

- How important is that feature?
  1 (just curious)
  3 (useful for my research project)
  5 (will solve a $1M dollar conjecture)

- How difficult is that feature?

- Is it already available in Sage?

  Remember that Sage includes 500k lines of code in its own library,
  and millions from other projects. So assessing might require some
  digging around or questioning the computational experts in this area.

- Are there implementations in other systems?

- Are there known algorithms?

  If so what are the building blocks required for those algorithms?

  Would those building blocks be useful in a larger setting?

- How much work would you, or some collaborator for your research
  project, be willing to put to get this feature?

- Would implementing this feature be a useful training for a new
  collaborator to get on board of your project, as a researcher?
