= What SAGE Can Do =

== Calculus ==

== Commutative Algebra ==
 * Computing a Groebner basis is fast because of the SINGULAR computer algebra system.

== Crypto ==

 * Classical ciphers are well supported.

== Elementary Education ==

 * The notebook is a useful tool for basic math education because of its flexible visualization/output capabilities.

== Finite Fields ==

 * Basic arithmetic over finite extension fields is fast because of the Givaro library.

== Graphical Interface ==

== Group Theory ==

== Linear Algebra ==

 * The reduced row echelon form of e.g. dense 20,000x20,000 matrices over GF(2) can be computed in seconds and 50MB of RAM.
 * Computation of reduced row echelon forms of sparse matrices is supported.
