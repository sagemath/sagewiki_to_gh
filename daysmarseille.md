We are organizing a Sage Days in Marseille from February 22 to February 26, 2010. See http://www.lirmm.fr/MathInfo2010

People from [[http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/|sage combinat]] are helping with the organisation, contact their [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-days/|mailing-list]] if you want to join.

The program is not established yet, we are discussing about : 
 * Sage in education
 * Algebraic combinatorics (Semi-groups, Coxeter groups, Representation Theory, graphs,...)
 * Discretized dynamical systems (combinatorics on words, tilings, train-tracks, Rauzy classes, origamis,...)
 * Simplicial homology
