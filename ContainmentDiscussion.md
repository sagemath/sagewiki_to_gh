== Modelisation of Containment in Sage ==

There are a lot of different usage of containment:

Objectifs:

 * Complete proven test

 * Probably true results {{{is_prime}}}

 * Fast test to rule out trivially wrong answer: three possible aswers: {{{False, True, Unknown}}}

 * short idiom to raise an error if the answer is False (eg: for type check)

 * containment module modulo identification/isomorphisms... Coercion/conversion.

Notes:

 * very similar question can be raised about equality


Needs: Let {{{P}}} be a parent and {{{x}}} a python data structure

 * {{{P(X)}}} build an element of {{{P}}}
 * coercion {{{P.coerce(X)}}}
 * we need a standardized way to write a function which is suppose to get an element of {{{P}}} but can take any coercible(convertible?) for syntactic sugar.
 * explicit conversion but without costly test.
