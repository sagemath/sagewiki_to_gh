= Sage Download Guide =

This guide explains, how to download Sage from one of the [[http://www.sagemath.org/mirrors.html|download mirrors]]. You need to know your operating system and maybe some specific information.

== Operating System ==

The first thing you have to know is your [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_System|operating system]]. When you computer boots, it probably displays a startup screen that tells it you. The second most important thing, if applicable, is your type of CPU: 32 bit, 64 bit, or something else like "atom" for netbooks.

 1. Microsoft Windows - you need to get a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware|vmware image]] for the VMWare virtual machine player. It runs Sage inside a virtual computer, which is acutally linux, and you can interact with Sage through your web-browser.

 2. Linux - there are several linux distributions and each binary we provide is special for that distribution. You also need to know if your CPU operats with 32 or 64 bits.

 3. Mac OSX - you have to know your processor (intel or PowerPC) and if your platform is based on 32 or 64 bits.

== Selection ==

If you know how to select your binary, you download it, extract it and you can run Sage. It is also possible to develop Sage with that binary.

If you are unsure about the system or you wish to compile it by yourself, download the source distribution. It is an archive that contains a base system with compressed sage SPKGs.
