== Bug Days Challenges ==

The sponsor of the bug-fixing days part of this workshop has the following high-priority challenges for us.  It would be great if we could resolve them all.

  * Improve the startup time of Sage (ticket?)
  * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10975|10975 -- creation of certain prime finite fields is double dog slow (compared to Magma)]] (patch up by stein; positive review -- David Roe)
  * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10801|10801 -- create a new option: "sage -strip" which deletes things that aren't needed for a binary distribution of sage, or for people that will never develop or upgrade]]
  * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10912|10912 -- add order setters and Tate and ate pairings]]
  * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10976|10976 -- computing order of a certain subgroup of a permutation group is double dog slow (compared to Magma)]]

 *  [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10832|10832]] Bug in simon_two_descent() (positively reviewed -- Weigandt)
 *  [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10745|10745]] Bug in Elliptic curves gens()
 *  [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10581|10581]] Change Large Cremona Database to mongodb format and extend it.
 *  [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10152|10152]] Bug in integral_points (for elliptic curves over Q)
 *  [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9371|9371]] 2-torsion rank over arbitrary fields
 
At Sage Days22, Rado Kirov and Jackie Anderson ported Magma code by John Cremona's student Nook (Thotsaphon Thongjunthug), to Sage.  The code adds support to Sage for finding integral points on elliptic curves over a number field.  This week, we moved this code into the Sage library, and made minor changes to support curves defined over the rationals as well. This code seems to fix #10152, and has been added to #10973 as a patch.  There are currently issues with performance, when compared with existing Magma code (when processing curves over Q).  We are looking at the performance issues (John, Gagan) and working on Nook's Magma code to add support for curves over Q (John, Justin).  Jen is working on her thesis.
