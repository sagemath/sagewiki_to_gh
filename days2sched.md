[:days2:SAGE Days 2] Schedule

NOTE: Talks on Sunday have been moved to room B326.

NOTE: Meeting Sunday night 8:00PM has been moved to [http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?OUG Odegaard].  Odegaard is open at all hours Sunday thru Thursday.  However, you'll need to get a guest pass to be in after 10:00PM -- and you'll need to be sponsored by a UW student / faculty member to do so.

The talks will take place in the basement of the
[http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?CMU Communications Building] on the
University of Washington campus in room B006.  (Note that Padelford (=Math) is 
across the street from communications.) See also the
[http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/campusmappg.pdf printable campus map in pdf format].
