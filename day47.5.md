= Sage Day 47.5: Combinatorial linear algebra in Sage =

== One Day: Tuesday, May 28, 2013 ==

== Location: PK-4120, LaCIM, UQAM, Montréal, Canada ==

  * Room PK-4120 is located in the [[http://www.uqam.ca/campus/pavillons/pk.htm|Président-Kennedy Building]]
  * [[http://lacim.uqam.ca/|LaCIM - Laboratoire de combinatoire et d'informatique mathématique]]

== Context ==

An impromptu Sage Day scheduled because of a confluence of visitors at LaCIM. This day is an opportunity for the participants to get some hands-on experience with Sage, with a focus on combinatorial linear algebra --- no talks are planned, only discussions, pair programming and coding sprints. The goals are:

  * Help people installing Sage on their computer
  * Explore Sage's (and Sage-Combinat's) current facilities for combinatorial linear algebra
  * Improve these facilities where appropriate, based on computations we would like to perform
  * Develop a roadmap for further improvements, if need be
  * Give the opportunity for Sage developers to meet and discuss
