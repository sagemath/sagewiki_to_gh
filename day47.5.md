# Sage Day 47.5: Combinatorial linear algebra in Sage


## One Day: Tuesday, May 28, 2013


## Location: PK-4130, LaCIM, UQAM, Montréal, Canada

   * Room PK-4130 is located in the <a class="http" href="http://www.uqam.ca/campus/pavillons/pk.htm">Président-Kennedy Building</a> 
   * <a class="http" href="http://lacim.uqam.ca/">LaCIM - Laboratoire de combinatoire et d'informatique mathématique</a> 

## Context

An impromptu Sage Day scheduled because of a confluence of visitors at LaCIM. This day is an opportunity for the participants to get some hands-on experience with Sage, with a focus on combinatorial linear algebra --- no talks are planned, only discussions, pair programming and coding sprints. The goals are: 

   * Help people installing Sage on their computer 
   * Explore Sage's (and Sage-Combinat's) current facilities for combinatorial linear algebra 
   * Improve these facilities where appropriate, based on computations we would like to perform 
   * Develop a roadmap for further improvements, if need be 
   * Give the opportunity for Sage developers to meet and discuss 

## Organizers

   * Mathieu Guay-Paquet 
   * Chris Berg 
   * Franco Saliola
