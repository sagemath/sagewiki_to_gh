'''''Vancouver, BC Canada'''''

<<TableOfContents()>>

These Sage Days are organized as a satellite event of the
[[https://sites.google.com/site/fpsac2016|FPSAC]] combinatorics conference.
The main mathematical topic will be '''combinatorics'''. Everyone is welcome
from Sage newcomers to advanced developers: there will be plenty of introductory
talks and also time for code sprints. '''It is the perfect occasion to learn Sage!'''

This is co-organized by [[https://www.pims.math.ca/|Pims]] and [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]].
