= Sage Days 78 --- June 29 to July 1st, 2016, Vancouver =

'''''Sage Days on Combinatorics'''''

'''''Vancouver, BC Canada'''''

<<TableOfContents()>>

These Sage Days are organized as a satellite event of the
[[https://sites.google.com/site/fpsac2016|FPSAC]] combinatorics conference.
The main mathematical topic will be '''combinatorics'''. Everyone is welcome
from Sage newcomers to advanced developers: there will be plenty of introductory
talks and also time for code sprints. '''It is the perfect occasion to learn Sage!'''

This is co-organized by [[https://www.pims.math.ca/|Pims]] and [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]].

Organizers: [[mailto:viviane.pons@lri.fr|Viviane Pons]] and [[mailto:jcourtie@sfu.ca|Julien Courtiel]]. 

== Dates and Venue ==

Date: 3 days '''From June 29 to July 1st, 2016'''

Venue: University of British Columbia, Vancouver

== Registration ==

Do you wish to give a talk or present a tutorial?*

''* A talk can be on anything related to mathematical development (it does not have to be Sage)
If you have some Sage experience, please consider giving a tutorial.''

== Financial Aid ==

A limited number of financial aids will be be distributed in priority to students and postdocs
to cover mostly local costs. Please apply before '''April 30''' by filling out this extra form
and sending it to [[mailto:viviane.pons@lri.fr|Viviane Pons]].

Current status (student, postdoc, etc.) :

Estimation of budget for the whole event (travel, lodging):

Do you also participate to the FPSAC conference?

Do you have other sources of funding for this event (FPSAC aid, local funding)?

== Program ==

This is a tentative program which is subject to evolutions depending on the requests and needs of the participants.

All talks are being held in '''Earth Science Building''' room 2012. [[http://www.maps.ubc.ca/PROD/index_detail.php?locat1=225| A map of the campus can be found here]].

* '''Open Problems in Combinatorial Representation Theory''' by Mike Zabrocki

Symmetric functions are a tool for understanding the decomposition of $S_n$/$Gl_n$ representations into irreducible subspaces.  The definitions that arise are well known computations and operations in linear algebra (inverting matrices, conjugation, Gram-Schmit orthogonalization, LU decomposition, etc.), but these computations are very slow compared to manipulations of combinatorial objects.

I'll choose 5 (time permitting) of what I consider some motivating open problems in symmetric functions/combinatorial representation theory.  This is a taste of what are just beyond the limits of algebraic combinatorics now.

 1. k-Schur functions and their structure coefficients
 2. diagonal harmonics, Garsia-Haiman modules, Macdonald symmetric functions, operator $\nabla$
 3. restriction of irreducible modules from $Gl_n$ to $S_n$ as permutation matricies
 4. plethysm and inner plethysm structure coefficients
 5. Kronecker product structure coefficients

Sage does all of these computations well, usually as a mix of linear algebra and combinatorics.  The algebra of symmetric functions encodes many common combinatorial objects in the coefficients: partitions, tableaux, subsets, words, integer matrices, lattice paths, Dyck paths, parking functions, set partitions, etc. and these objects are used as building blocks to describe combinatorial decompositions.

** '''Introduction to code sprints'''

A ''code sprint'' is a get-together of people around a particular software development project. During Sage days, code sprints are the occasion for everyone to get to work on a Sage project whether it is to go through the tutorials, to start exploring the part of Sage related to their research, or to get together with other participants to work on a needed feature. Sage days bring together Sage newbies along with more advanced developers: it is the perfect occasion for everyone to meet, share, learn, and code together! Every evening, we will have ''status report'' so that everyone can share their progress on the different projects.
