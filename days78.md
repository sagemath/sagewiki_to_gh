= Sage Days 78 - June 29 -- July 1st, 2016, Vancouver =

'''''Sage Days on Combinatorics'''''

'''''Vancouver, BC Canada'''''

<<TableOfContents()>>

These Sage Days are organized as a satellite event of the [[https://sites.google.com/site/fpsac2016|FPSAC]] combinatorics conference. The main mathematical topic will be '''combinatorics'''. Every one is welcome from Sage new comers to advanced developers: there will be plenty of introduction talks and also time for code sprints. '''It is the perfect occasion to learn Sage!'''

This is co-organized by [[https://www.pims.math.ca/|Pims]] and [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]].
