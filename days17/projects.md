<<TableOfContents>>

== Rational Cuspidal Subgroups ==

  * See http://wstein.org/home/wstein/db/days17/cuspidal_torsion/ for some data.

== Dimensions of Modular Forms Spaces for Gamma(N) ==

 See [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6860|#6860]].

== Pre-Sage Days Stuff ==

 See [[/presagedays|projects]].  There are numerous ideas for projects there.

== Implement the Hijikata Trace Formula ==

There are PARI and Magma implementations here along with some scans:

http://modular.fas.harvard.edu/Tables/hijikata.html

Do a Sage implementation.  Then do some interesting computations say of the trace of $T_2$ on some high weight spaces...
