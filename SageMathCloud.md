# SageMathCloud

**SageMathCloud** is the former name of what is now **<a href="/CoCalc">CoCalc</a>**. 

This cloud service for computation and collaboration, operated by <a href="/SageMathInc">SageMath, Inc</a>, initially available at <a class="https" href="https://cloud.sagemath.com">cloud.sagemath.com</a>, is now available at <a class="https" href="https://cocalc.com">cocalc.com</a>. 

The old address <a class="https" href="https://cloud.sagemath.com">cloud.sagemath.com</a> redirects to the new address <a class="https" href="https://cocalc.com">cocalc.com</a>. 

All SageMathCloud accounts were turned into CoCalc accounts. Users can access them with the same username and password (or using Facebook, GitHub, Google, or Twitter authentication). 

The initial name reflects the goal to make SageMath available online, without having to install anything on one's computer. 

The new name emphasizes that CoCalc, more than just a way to use SageMath, offers a whole collaborative calculation environment.
