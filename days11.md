 * Capital Metro has a bus (the Airport Flyer, Route 100) that runs between the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA) and central Austin. Its schedule can be found [http://www.capmetro.org/riding/schedules.asp?f1=100 here]. It doesn't have many stops, but they are all centrally located and intersect other bus routes.
 * There are also plenty of cabs and shared-ride vans as well.
