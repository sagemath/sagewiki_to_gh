NOTE: The Supercomputing 2008 conference (officially known as SC08) is
described here: http://sc08.supercomputing.org/  It takes place from
November 15-21 at the Austin convention center.

== Ground Transportation ==

Austin's bus system is run by [http://www.capmetro.org/ Capital Metro] which has a number of bus routes that service the UT campus.

=== To and From the Airport ===

There are a couple of options to get to and from the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA).

 * Capital Metro has a bus (the Airport Flyer, Route 100) that runs between ABIA and central Austin. Its schedule can be found [http://www.capmetro.org/riding/schedules.asp?f1=100 here]. It doesn't have many stops, but they are all centrally located and intersect other bus routes. Many UT graduate students use the Airport Flyer and find that it is a very inexpensive and easy way to travel ($1 for a 24-hour pass). This may be due to their knowledge of the bus system and knowing what bus to take get home.
 * There are also plenty of cabs and shared-ride vans as well.

My suggestion would be to use the Airport Flyer if your hotel is centrally located. Otherwise a cab or shared-ride van is probably your best option.
