== Hotel Info ==

A block of rooms has been reserved for us at the Doubletree Guest Suites, 303 W. 15th St, Austin, Texas. [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=doubletree,+15th+st,+austin,+texas&ie=UTF8&ll=30.27986,-97.741971&spn=0.020161,0.025878&z=15 Here] is a link to a google maps view of the hotel.

== Ground Transportation ==

Austin's bus system is run by [http://www.capmetro.org/ Capital Metro] which has a number of bus routes that service the UT campus. UT shuttle buses are marked by white and burnt orange buses that use letters for their route as opposed to numbers. UT shuttles are free to ride.

=== To and From the Airport ===

There are a couple of options to get to and from the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA).

 * Capital Metro has a bus (the Airport Flyer, Route 100) that runs between ABIA and central Austin. Its schedule can be found [http://www.capmetro.org/riding/schedules.asp?f1=100 here]. It doesn't have many stops, but they are all centrally located and intersect other bus routes. Many UT graduate students use the Airport Flyer and find that it is a very inexpensive and easy way to travel ($1 for a 24-hour pass). This may be due to their knowledge of the bus system and knowing what bus to take get home.
 * There are also plenty of cabs and shared-ride vans as well.

If you will be staying at the Doubletree Suites, you can take the Airport Flyer to 15th and Lavaca St, right next to the hotel. Otherwise, if your hotel is centrally located, my suggestion would be to use the Airport Flyer. A cab or shared-ride van is probably your best option if your hotel is not along the Airport Flyer route. It takes about 20-30 minutes to reach central Austin from the airport (depending on traffic).

=== To and From RLM ===

Robert Lee Moore (RLM) Hall is the home of the Math Department at UT. Maps of the University can be found [http://www.utexas.edu/maps/ here] -- click on the "4" to get a zoom in of RLM, at the corner of Dean Keaton St and Speedway St. A picture of RLM can be found [http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/rlm.html here].

==== From the Doubletree Suites ====

 * Walking: You can walk from the hotel to RLM by walking one block west along 15th St to Guadalupe St, walking north along Guadalupe, and making a right to walk east once you get to Dean Keaton. RLM will be on the corner of Dean Keaton and Speedway, on the south side of Dean Keaton. 
 * Bus: You can take the Enfield Road (ER) or Lake Austin (LA) UT shuttle that Capital Metro runs. They both can be grabbed along 15th St and will wind you around campus. 
  * Going to RLM, you will want to get off on 21st St and Speedway, walk along Speedway north (the bus drops you off on the north side of 21st St) to RLM.
  * Returning from RLM, you will want to grab the bus at the 21st and Speedway stop and take it to Guadalupe St and 15th St, walk east along 15th St one block to Lavaca St and the Doubletree Suites.
  * After 7pm, the ER and LA combine routes to become the ER/LA route. It runs until 11pm and has the same route around campus as the ER and LA do separately.
