= SAGE Days 4 =

The 4th SAGE days 2007 will be held the week of June 12-17, 2007 (a Tuesday through Sunday) in the Mathematics Department of the University of Washington in scenic Seattle.

The conference has been fully funded by the NSF UW/VIGRE and PIMS, so there is no registration fee and some participants costs will be reimbursed.  Thanks NSF and PIMS!!

The focus will be on coding sprints, rather than talks on various SAGE-related topics. Namely, it is planned to be a developers workshop, with fewer general audience talks but plenty of opportunity to talk and work with others.
