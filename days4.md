The 4th SAGE days 2007, to be held the week of June 12-17, 2007 (a Tuesday thru Sunday) in the Mathematics Department of the University of Washington in scenic Seattle.

The focus will be on coding sprints, rather than talks on various SAGE-related topics. Namely, it is planned to be a developers workshop, with fewer general audience talks.
