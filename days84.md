= Sage Days 84 : Polytopes in Sage =

'''''February 27th - March 10th 2017'''''
'''''[[http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/42.1772/2.4901|Olot, Catalunya, Spain]]'''''

These (Sage) days will be focused on Polytopes and linear programming. This workshop is dedicated to people already familiar with Sage or being active in some polytope related libraries/software.

There is a very limited number of places. If you are interested get quickly in contact with Vincent Delecroix (vincentDOTdelecroixATuDASHbordeaux.fr).

During the workshop participants will have to cook several times for everybody. Bring your favorite recipies!

== Coming to Olot ==

The Sage Days will happen at [[http://faberresidency.com/|FABER]] in [[http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/42.1772/2.4901|Olot]]. It is a small town close to Girona (55km) and Barcelona (110km). To reach Olot there are at least two options:

 * [[http://www.teisa-bus.com/es/horarios|buses TEISA]] from either Girona or Barcelona
 * [[http://www.viesverdes.cat/FR/53/route-du-petit-train-i.html|nice bike path from Girona]]

== Projects ==

 * develop interfaces to polytope libraries/softwares (ppl, polymake, etc)
 * moving as independent Python packages the Sage interfaces to cdd, ppl, etc (see e.g. [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pplpy/|pplpy]])
 * make a generic number field implementation in C/C++ using normaliz
 * add mutable polytopes in Sage
 * Delaunay/Voronoi polytopes of lattices (-> algorithm for norm form equation)
 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22006|#22006: CBC tries to use system's blas at runtime which creates an error]]
 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20875|#20875: Meta-ticket: Polytopes, lattice (integer) point counting / enumeration, and their applications]]
 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20302|#20302: Meta-ticket: Improvements to MixedIntegerLinearProgram etc.]]
 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18703|#18703: oriented matroids]]
 * ... (add your project!)
