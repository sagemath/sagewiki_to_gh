= Session Schedule: MAA PREP Workshop =

Each day is a total of four hours online, broken into two 2-hour sessions.  Please get setup in Elluminate a few minutes before the start time.  We will post links to recordings of each session to the course email list shortly after the conclusion of the session.

  * Session I:  8-10 Pacific, 11-1 Eastern
  * Session II:  Noon-2 Pacific, 3-5 Eastern


== Saturday, May 22 ==

Our goal on the first day is to get everybody comfortable enough in the notebook interface that they can begin to productively explore their own interests in Sage independently.  So we will concentrate on the basic use and the various ways to get help and learn more.  Questions are encouraged!
