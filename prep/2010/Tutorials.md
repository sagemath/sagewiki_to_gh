= Tutorials for Sage 2010 PREP workshop =

This page is the home of tutorials from the summer 2010 MAA PREP workshop "Sage: Using Open-Source Mathematics Software with Undergraduates" (funding provided by NSF DUE 0817071).

== Basic Tutorials ==

  * The [[attachment:PREP Intro Tutorial.sws|first tutorial]] is about the absolute basics of evaluating mathematics, defining functions, finding help, and annotating Sage worksheets.

  * The [[attachment:PREP Tutorial, Symbolics and Basic Plotting.sws|second tutorial]] demonstrates the basics of using symbolic expressions and plotting in Sage.

  * The third tutorial introduces the most common uses of Sage within the (extended) [[attachment:PREP Tutorial, Symbolics and Basic Plotting.sws|calculus]] sequence.

== Advanced Tutorials ==

  * There is an introduction to more advanced plotting techniques, in two parts.

  * We also provide an introduction to the most basic [[attachment:PREP Tutorial, Introductory Programming.sws|programming]] skills needed for advanced use of Sage.

  * The interactive capabilities of Sage for classroom demonstration or lab use are relatively easy to use; this worksheet has little dialogue, but shows how one can go from a simple command to a complex "Sagelet" in a slow, step-by-step manner.

== Topical Quickstarts ==

We also have additional mini-tutorials for specific subfields of undergraduate mathematics as implemented in Sage and its components.
