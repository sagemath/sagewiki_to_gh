= Tutorials for Sage 2010 PREP workshop =

This page will be the home of tutorials from the summer 2010 MAA PREP workshop "Sage: Using Open-Source Mathematics Software with Undergraduates" (funding provided by NSF DUE 0817071).

== Basic Tutorials ==

  * The first tutorial was about the absolute basics of evaluating mathematics, defining functions, finding help, and annotating Sage worksheets.

  * The second tutorial demonstrated the basics of using symbolic expressions and plotting in Sage.

  * The third tutorial will introduce the most common uses of Sage within the (extended) calculus sequence.

== Topical Tutorials ==

Later in the summer we will have additional tutorials for specific subfields of undergraduate mathematics.
