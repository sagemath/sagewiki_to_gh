= MAA PREP Program, Summer 2011 =

Sage ([[http://www.sagemath.org]]) is free, open-source, and comprehensive mathematics software. You will discover
how to use Sage to enhance your courses, customized to your institution and curriculum. There will be four
one-day online sessions during the summer. The first day will introduce you to Sage, followed by a two-week
period during which you will, with support of the organizers, familiarize yourself with the software.
The remaining days, each one week apart, will focus on creating curricular materials, effectively using Sage
in the classroom, and feedback on content you have created in the workshop. In the weeks between the
sessions, you will explore Sage on your own schedule, with dedicated online “office hours” from the
organizers.

No previous usage of Sage is assumed.

Online workshop dates are: May 24, June 7, June 14, and June 21, 2011.  Each day we will meet online from 11 AM to 1 PM and 3 PM to 5 PM Eastern Daylight Time, in order to allow participants from as many North American time zones as possible.

== Registration ==

To register, visit [[http://www.maa.org/prep/]]. 

== Equipment needed ==

Participants will need:
  * A standards-compliant web browser (e.g., Firefox or Safari) and a high-speed internet connection.  This will allow the participant to use  Sage over the internet and participate in the teleconference sessions.
  * A headset with earphones and a mic.  This will allow the participant to participate in the teleconference sessions.  Or regular headphones and any kind of microphone (built-in or plug-in).  You CANNOT listen to audio over speakers and speak to the group simultaneously, so you must have something like a headset, headphones, or earphone to listen to the audio.

== Resources ==

There are a number of online resources for learning about Sage in education.  Several useful ones include:
  * The [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu|sage-edu Google group]] is a discussion area for ideas about using Sage in education.
  * The [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|sage-support Google group]] is a support list for general or specific questions about Sage.
  * There is a good [[interact|section of the Sage wiki]] devoted to sample interactive demonstrations, or "Sagelets".
