== Basic Tutorials ==

  * The [[attachment:PREP Intro Tutorial.sws|first tutorial]] is about the absolute basics of evaluating mathematics, defining functions, finding help, and annotating Sage worksheets.

  * The [[attachment:PREP Tutorial, Symbolics and Basic Plotting.sws|second tutorial]] demonstrates the basics of using symbolic expressions and plotting in Sage.

  * The third tutorial introduces the most common uses of Sage within the (extended) [[attachment:PREP Tutorial, Symbolics and Basic Plotting.sws|calculus]] sequence.

== Advanced Tutorials ==

  * There is a two-part introduction to more advanced plotting techniques. 

    * [[attachment:PREP Tutorial- Advanced 2d plotting.sws|Advanced 2D Plotting]] 
    * [[attachment:PREP Tutorial, Advanced Plotting, Part 2.sws|Advanced 3D Plotting]]

  * We also provide an introduction to the most basic [[attachment:PREP Tutorial, Introductory Programming.sws|programming]] skills needed for advanced use of Sage.

  * The interactive capabilities of Sage for classroom demonstration or lab use are relatively easy to use.  There is little dialogue in [[attachment:PREP Quickstart Interact.sws|this worksheet]], but it nonetheless shows effectively how one can go from a simple command to a complex "Sagelet" in a slow, step-by-step manner.

== Topical Quickstarts ==

We also have additional mini-tutorials for specific subfields of undergraduate mathematics as implemented in Sage and its components.
