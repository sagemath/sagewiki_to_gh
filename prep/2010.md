= MAA PREP Program, Summer 2010 =

Sage ([[http://www.sagemath.org]]) is free, open-source, and comprehensive mathematics
software. You will discover how to use Sage to enhance your courses, customized to your
institution and curriculum. There will be three online sessions during the summer; one day
will introduce you to Sage, a two-day session will emphasize creating curricular materials,
and the final day will help you take full advantage of Sage in the classroom (we expect all of these to run 11-1 and 3-5, Eastern Time).
Between sessions, you will explore Sage on your own schedule, with dedicated online "office hours"
from the organizers. 

No previous usage of Sage is assumed.

== Resources ==

There are a number of online resources for learning about Sage in education.  Several useful ones include:
  * The [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu|sage-edu Google group]] is a discussion area for ideas about using Sage in education.
  * The [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|sage-support Google group]] is a support list for general or specific questions about Sage.
  * There is a good [[interact|section of the Sage wiki]] devoted to sample interactive demonstrations, or "Sagelets".
