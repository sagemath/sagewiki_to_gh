= MAA PREP Program, Summer 2010 =

Sage ([[http://www.sagemath.org]]) is free, open-source, and comprehensive mathematics
software. You will discover how to use Sage to enhance your courses, customized to your
institution and curriculum. There will be three online sessions during the summer; one day
will introduce you to Sage, a two-day session will emphasize creating curricular materials,
and the final day will help you take full advantage of Sage in the classroom. 
Between sessions, you will explore Sage on your own schedule, with dedicated online "office hours"
from the organizers. 

No previous usage of Sage is assumed.
