# MAA PREP Program, Summer 2010

Sage (<a class="http" href="http://www.sagemath.org">http://www.sagemath.org</a>) is free, open-source, and comprehensive mathematics software. You will discover how to use Sage to enhance your courses, customized to your institution and curriculum. There will be three online sessions during the summer; one day will introduce you to Sage, a two-day session will emphasize creating curricular materials, and the final day will help you take full advantage of Sage in the classroom (we expect all of these to run 11-1 and 3-5, Eastern Time). Between sessions, you will explore Sage on your own schedule, with dedicated online "office hours" from the organizers.  

No previous usage of Sage is assumed. 


## Schedule

There is a separate page with a <a href="/prep/2010/sessions">detailed schedule</a> for the workshop sessions and office hours with the organizers. 

The <a href="/prep/2010/Tutorials">tutorials</a> for the workshop will be posted as they come out. 


## Elluminate TeleConference System

The four online sessions will be conducted with Elluminate software.  Here is <a href="/prep/2010/TeleConference">our guide</a> for technical, logistical and productive use of this system. 


## Resources

There are a number of online resources for learning about Sage in education.  Several useful ones include: 

   * The <a class="http" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu">sage-edu Google group</a> is a discussion area for ideas about using Sage in education. 
   * The <a class="http" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support">sage-support Google group</a> is a support list for general or specific questions about Sage. 
   * There is a good <a href="/interact">section of the Sage wiki</a> devoted to sample interactive demonstrations, or "Sagelets". 

## Registration

Registration is now closed.  For more information about the PREP program in general, visit <a class="http" href="http://www.maa.org/prep/">http://www.maa.org/prep/</a>. 


## Equipment needed

Participants will need: 

   * A standards-compliant web browser (e.g., Firefox or Safari) and a high-speed internet connection.  This will allow the participant to use  Sage over the internet and participate in the teleconference sessions. 
   * A headset with earphones and a mic.  This will allow the participant to participate in the teleconference sessions.  Or regular headphones and any kind of microphone (built-in or plug-in).  You CANNOT listen to audio over speakers and speak to the group simultaneously, so you must have something like a headset, headphones, or earphone to listen to the audio.
