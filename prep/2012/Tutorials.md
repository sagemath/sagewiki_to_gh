This page is the home of tutorials from the summer 2012 MAA PREP workshop "Sage: Using Open-Source Mathematics Software with Undergraduates" (funding provided by NSF DUE 0817071).

Warning: gray links are not yet uploaded.  We will be be updating these as we have time; participants have access to them via the Sage server for the workshop. 


## Basic Tutorials

   * The <a href="prep/2012/Tutorials/PREP Intro Tutorial.sws">first tutorial</a> is about the absolute basics of evaluating mathematics, defining functions, finding help, and annotating Sage worksheets. 
   * The <a href="prep/2012/Tutorials/PREP Tutorial, Symbolics and Basic Plotting.sws">second tutorial</a> demonstrates the basics of using symbolic expressions and plotting in Sage. 
   * The third tutorial introduces the most common uses of Sage within the (extended) <a href="prep/2012/Tutorials/PREP Tutorial, Symbolics and Basic Plotting.sws">calculus</a> sequence. 

## Advanced Tutorials

   * There is a two-part introduction to more advanced plotting techniques.  
         * <a href="prep/2012/Tutorials/PREP Tutorial- Advanced 2d plotting.sws">Advanced 2D Plotting</a>  
         * <a href="prep/2012/Tutorials/PREP Tutorial, Advanced Plotting, Part 2.sws">Advanced 3D Plotting</a> 
   * We also provide an introduction to the most basic <a href="prep/2012/Tutorials/PREP Tutorial, Introductory Programming.sws">programming</a> skills needed for advanced use of Sage. 
   * The interactive capabilities of Sage for classroom demonstration or lab use are relatively easy to use.  There is little dialogue in <a href="prep/2012/Tutorials/PREP Quickstart Interact.sws">this worksheet</a>, but it nonetheless shows effectively how one can go from a simple command to a complex "Sagelet" in a slow, step-by-step manner. 

## Topical Quickstarts

We also have additional mini-tutorials for specific subfields of undergraduate mathematics as implemented in Sage and its components.
