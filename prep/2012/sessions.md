= Session Schedule: MAA PREP Workshop =

Summer 2012

Each day is a total of four hours online, broken into two 2-hour sessions.  Please get set up in Blackboard Collaborate a few minutes before the start time, paying special attention to the [[prep/2012/TeleConference|guidelines]] (especially about your session name and headphones).  We will post links to recordings of each session to the course email list shortly after the conclusion of the session.

  * Session I:  8-10 Pacific, 11-1 Eastern
  * Session II:  Noon-2 Pacific, 3-5 Eastern

[[#homework|Homework]] and [[#officehours|Office Hours]] are listed after all the sessions.

  * [[#day1|Tuesday, June 26]]
  * [[#day2|Tuesday, July 10]]
  * [[#day3|Tuesday, July 17]]
  * [[#day4|Tuesday, July 24]]

== Tuesday, June 26 ==

Our goal on the first day is to get everybody comfortable enough in the notebook interface that they can begin to productively explore their own interests in Sage independently.  So we will concentrate on basic use and the various ways to get help and learn more.

Questions are encouraged!  With that in mind, note that we have ample time for addressing questions that come up during the presentations.  You should feel free to message in Blackboard Collaborate anything that comes to mind, and we'll be sure to address as many as possible during the actual session.

== Office Hours ==

Please connect as usual in Blackboard Collaborate, and give the organizer a minute or two to recognize you if there is nobody else around, or they are busy with someone else.  ("Raising your hand" should provide an audible alert on the organizer's end.)  See the [[prep/2012/TeleConference|guide]] for information on sharing your worksheet out via Blackboard Collaborate.  This might be a useful way for us to help you with problems.

And of course feel free to ask any questions on the MAA list for the
workshop, or support question on
[[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|sage-support]].
