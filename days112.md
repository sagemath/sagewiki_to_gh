= Sage Days 112 Online, February-March 2021 =

[[http://sagemath.org|Sage]] is an open source software for mathematics. This is the webpage for the Sage workshop for [[https://www.irif.fr/~codys/Accueil|ANR CODYS]]. The aim is to:

 * introduce Sage to people in the ANR

 * implement Loick Lhote's code to compute spectrum of transfer operators on continued fraction algorithms.

 * help people to implement their own projects

The workshop will take place on two Thusrday mornings to be determined replacing the weekly sage seminar [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/thursdaysbdx|thursdaysbdx]].
