= Mike Hansen's Status Report for Sage Days 12 =

== I fixed the following bugs: ==

=== Notebook ===

* #3201 - notebook -- bug in parsing \ at end of line in %latex mode

* #4524 - interact : incomplete default string in the input box

* #3326 - trailing question marks in %html blocks are mistreated

* #3820 - notebook -- sometimes published worksheets are listed as being published by pub.

* #4820 - Syntax error for a comment line, then help query in a notebook cell

* #4011 - notebook -- copying a worksheet on worksheet listings page results in the new worksheet being listed as running

* #4245 - notebook -- error clicking editing when there is a < in the html.

* #4316 - notebook: '%html $x<y$' doesn't work right

* #4010 - notebook -- Renaming worksheet: clicking OK with a blank text box should revert to worksheet's old name not name it to "null"

* #313 - Slideshow doesn't update correctly when first cell deleted.

* #1897 - %latex -- bug in passing in predefined sage variables (serious but probably very easy to fix)

* #1019 - strange behavior in notebook with %octave

=== Interfaces ===

* #3294 - GAP interface broken after CTRL-C

* #3752 - gap.eval -- oddity in parsing multiline input and comments

* #4590 - sage/interfaces/phc.py writes tmp files into cwd

* #3268 - Fix GAP interface printing

=== Misc ===

* #2638 - complex QQbar expressions exceed maximum recursion depth when exact computation is triggered

* #4405 - double/single quotation marks in docstring

* #2402 - there should be a hg_examples mercurial wrapper for the examples repository

* #5051 - tracebacks involving cython (etc.) seriously broken in sage-3.3.alpha0 (probably caused by ipython)

* #5073 - Update IPython to 0.9.1

* #4152 - parametric_plot should take the variable range as (var, min, max) like plot
