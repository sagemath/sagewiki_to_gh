# Jason Grout's Status Report for Sage Days 12


## I fixed the following bugs:


### Reviewed and merged

* #4963 - Make a screen-full of whitespace at the bottom of the notebook cells 
* #4563 - polar plot does not accept (t, 0, 2*pi) syntax for the interval 
* #4152 (with Mike Hansen) - parametric_plot should take the variable range as (var, min, max) like plot 

## Still under review or needs more work

* #5025 - tinymce issues 
* #4786 - fix some bugs / typos in the solve function 
In preparation for fixing scipy and plotting bugs, I also worked quite a bit on updating the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib spkgs.  I also reviewed quite a few of Mike Hansen's notebook fixes.
