== I fixed the following bugs: ==

=== Modular Symbols (with Craig Citro) ===

 * #1127 - modularSymbol complement fails for E=128a

 * #2535 - Problem with cuspidal_subspace and new_subspace for modular symbols

NOTE: We used a naive approach to solving both of these issues, but there is more to be done about complement() and dual_free_module() for submodules of modular symbols, see for instance the new #5080 that was uncovered by Robert Bradshaw and Craig Citro.

=== Packages ===

 * #4322 - modular polynomials database is broken

 * #4755 - !CremonaDatabase().number_of_curves() should work when the optional database isn't installed

=== Number Theory ===

 * 3045 - K.gen() where K = GF(p) returns 1, not a primitive element

=== Calculus ===

 * #2404 - subs_expr claims to take a dictionary, but doesn't

=== Documentation ===

 * #5087 - purge "cannonical" typos
