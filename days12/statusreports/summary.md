\hd{Math}%
Stein fixed bugs in Sage's use of mwrank, factorization of
multivariate polynomials over finite fields, the elliptic curve
database, multivariate polynomial arithmetic, ring changes and hashing over Givaro finite fields, kernels of integer matrices and getting help on primes.

Albrecht fixed several bugs in univariate and multivariate polynomials which could lead tosegmentation faults and wrong results in computations. Perry improved the support for multivariate polynomial rings over finite fields with large prime characteristic.


Albrecht and Perry worked on an F4-style F5 algorithm and finished a toy implementation of it.


\hd{Graphics}%
Stein fixed bugs in parametric and list 3d plotting.

Albrecht fixed bugs in the visualization of the structure of matrices.

\hd{System}%
Stein fixed PATH issues, doctesting of spyx and sage files, the -notebook option, getting memory
usage, cached gap workspaces, loading of magma/sage interface files, and make check.

\hd{Testing}%
Stein removed some long doctests that left cruft around.
