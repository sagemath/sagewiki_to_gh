== Burcin's status report for SD 12 ==

=== pynac ===

 * print higher degree terms first
 * added:
  * support for symbolic binomial and factorial
  * `.latex()` method
  * `.collect_common_factors()`
  * iterators and `__getitem__`
  * `.function()` method to allow creating `CallableSymbolicExpressions` with pynac expressions

Changes above will be in the pynac-0.1.2 release, which should be released with Sage 3.3.

I have patches that

 * add constants for `Infinity` and `UnsignedInfinity` (to pynac)
 * implement arithmetic with infinity
 * make 1/gamma(-1) = 0 
 * fix series expansion of 1/(1/sqrt(x) + 1/x)

which need to be cleaned up and tested more. They should be available for testing before I get home (next Tuesday).
