Note that after founding SageMath (free software for mathematics) in 2005,
William Stein later founded a company called [[SageMathInc|SageMath, Inc.]],
whose goal is to raise money for the development of SageMath (the software).
The product developed by "!SageMath, Inc." towards this goal is CoCalc,
which started out under the name SageMathCloud. Note that while SageMathCloud
was renamed CoCalc, this has no incidence on SageMath, which remains SageMath.

The name Sage has been used for a lot of things, including several
software systems, some of which with mathematical capability.

Amazon launched a hosted machine learning platform called [[https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker|SageMaker]], which has absolutely nothing directly to do with Sage (though it uses similar technologies and even has at least one developer in common).
