 * It is a walking distance from campus: [http://tinyurl.com/65tmy2 googlemaps],
 * It is 14 euros/night, that we could maybe get slightly down with a group fare,
 * The bed-sheet service and breakfast are included,
 * There is no individual room but small capacity dormitories: 3 to 4 beds each.

Anyone interested to join the group reservation, please register by editing your name in the following list, or send an email at {{{clement . pernet [at] gmail.com}}}.

Please sign up until '''Septembre 16''', so that we could contact the Hostel early enough with a good idea of the number of persons.
