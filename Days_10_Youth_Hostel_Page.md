Since the youth Hostel [http://www.fuaj.org/Nancy# "Un petit coin de Paradis"] is full, we are now planning on a reservation at [http://www.maison-des-chercheurs-nancy.imhotel.fr/index_en.php "La maison des chercheurs"].

 * It is still a walking distance from campus
 * There is a limited number of twin bedrooms (4 to 5), which would cost about 23euros/night/person
 * There is a number of studios for the rest of the group which would cost about 37euros/night

The reservation is imminent, so if you are not listed on this page, contact {{{clement . pernet [at] gmail.com}}} as soon as possible.
I am also waiting for everyone listed here to confirm me by email that this option works, and if they have a preference between single or double room. 
I'll try to organize rooms as well as I can, so there is no garanty that you end up having a twin room even if you said you would prefer one.
