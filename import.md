This page tries to summarize the results of the discussion on [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/0sYJMlN16bc| sage-devel]]
I formulate everything here as strict rules, but of course every guideline can have a valid use case for not following it, but stating things in a political correct way would just obfuscate the main ideas.
<<TableOfContents(2)>>

= Possible Guide Lines =



== Execute as less as possible code in modules which are imported at startup ==
----
=== Opinion on sage-dev ===

Most people find it a good idea.

==== Solutions to concrete problems ====

If you want to have some precomputed data available in the top level of your module, don't precompute at startup time, use the cached_function decorator instead.

==== Examples ====
 * '''bad'''

{{{
special_matrix_list = initialize_special_matrix_list()
}}}

 * '''good'''

{{{
@cached_function
def special_matrix_list():
    return initialize_special_matrix_list()
}}}


== Use relative imports ==
----
==== Opinion on sage-dev ====
Mixed, most think it is not a good idea.
==== Pros ====
 * This might speed up startup time

==== Cons ====
 * A lot of work to change the existing code
 * There is doubt if this will really enhance startup time a lot
 * Absolute imports are not ambigious hence easier to read
 * Volker Braun has a workaround that caches import locations between Sage runs.

== Start making use of __init__.py files ==
----
==== Opinion on sage-dev ====
N/A since this idea has to be developed more first
==== Pros ====
 * Will hopfully make the source code easier maintainable
 * Allows you to use sage as a library (i.e. you no longer have to do from sage.all import *)
 * Might give shorter startup time when you tell sage to startup only with a certain submodule loaded (for example `sage -import_only rings`)
==== Cons ====
 * Just the use of __init__.py files will not make sage useable as a library, more work needs to be done (eg environment variables etc)

==== Related Ideas ====
 * Make it possible to run the doctest suite run only with a certain submodule imported 


== Don't import specific functions or classes from another module ==
----

==== opinion on sage-dev ====
To early to tell.
==== Pros ====
 * Decreases the chance of circular imports and hence increases sourcecode maintainability
==== Cons ====
 * There are definitly valid use cases to importing specific functions and classes.

 * speed 
{{{
import sage.rings.all
}}} 
will force 4? lookups at runtime when later executing 
{{{
sage.rings.all.ZZ(3)
}}}
while
{{{
from sage.rings.all import ZZ
}}}
will cause 1? lookup at runtime when later executing
{{{
ZZ(3)
}}}
==== Solutions to concrete problems ====
To be provided

==== Examples ====
'''bad:'''  {{{import module.a.b.c.d }}}  #slow at runtime

'''good:'''   {{{from module.a.b.c import d}}}

'''bad:'''

{{{from module.sub_module import some_function}}} #cause of problems with possible circular imports

{{{from module.sub_module import some_class}}}  #cause of problems with possible circular imports


'''good:'''

{{{from module.sub_module import some_sub_sub_module}}}

{{{import module}}}


'''valid use case to ignore this guideline:'''
