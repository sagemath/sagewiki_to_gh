= Sage Days X > 48 =

From 22 July till 26 July 2013 there will be a [[http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/|Lorentz Center]] workshop on Arithmetic Geometry in Sage. There will be three main projects during this week.

 * The first project is to enhance the function field functionality of Sage. In particular, it is important to have algorithms for computing with Jacobians of algebraic curves. This project is motivated by the other two projects.

 * The second project is to work on a new implementation of the algorithm of [[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9491.html|Edixhoven, Couveignes et al.]] for computing Galois representations attached to modular forms.

 * The third project is to work on computing semi stable models of curves over local fields. To be more precise the goal is to work towards a practical implementation of the algorithms that follow from the proof in: K. Arzdorf and S. Wewers, A local proof of the semistable reduction theorem.

 * A possible fourth project might be to speed up finite fields in sage. Faster finite fields will mean that the algorithms in the previous project will also be significantly faster. According to [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-nt/4tu8csrrWJo/gxY95f8s5FkJ|a google group discussion]] it should be easy to make finite fiels larger than 2^16 a factor 10 faster. If you are interested in working on this, please let us know.
