# SAGE Bug Squash Day 8

The event will take place on **Wednesday, January 2, 2008** and officially start at 9 am pacific standard time. 

Remember the "Twisted Rule" -- Don't work on **anything** unless there is a trac ticket for it. 

* The base version of SAGE we'll start with is **2.9.2.alphaX**. 
* <a href="/bug8/status">STATUS</a> 
* <a href="/bug8/irc">IRC log</a> 
* Write to <a href="mailto:wstein@gmail.com">wstein@gmail.com</a> for an account on the bug tracker. 
* We'll all be on #sage-devel at irc.freenode.net. 

```txt
From Linux you can chat via a text console by installing "irssi", running it, and typing
  /SERVER add irc.freenode.net
  /SERVER irc.freenode.net
  /join #sage-devel
```
If you are using Konversation (the KDE IRC client), you can set up an auto-replace rule that lets you type #1322 (for trac #1322) and what everyone sees is <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/1322">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/1322</a> (which lets people click on the link and see the bug you are talking about). 

To configure this, go to Settings -> Configure Konversation -> Behavior -> Auto Replace and create a rule with Find as "#([0-9]+)" and Replace with as "<a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/%1">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/%1</a>" (both without the quotes).  You can select whether this rule is applied to incoming posts, your outgoing posts, or both.
