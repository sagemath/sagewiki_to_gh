(or rather postponed to some ulterior dates)

== Goal ==

This is a small-scale workshop for Sage developers with a specific focus on porting
Sage to Python 3. While a lot of effort has been done for this,
we hope that this workshop will accelerate this.

== Organizer ==

 * Jeroen Demeyer (Ghent University)

== Participants ==

 * Frédéric Chapoton (CNRS &amp; Université de Strasbourg)
 * Jeroen Demeyer (Ghent University)

== Funding ==

For participants without travel grants, the [[https://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]] project has some money available.


== Some specific tasks ==

1. ensure that "make doc" works : see patchbot reports with python3 on ticket 0 (https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/)

  A. Make sure that the pdf documentation builds correctly: https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25840, upgrade sagenb, fix src/sage/combinat/root_system/plot.py

  A. update some packages

    a. ✓ update pynac : https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24838 ; https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24751 ; https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24752

    a. update sagenb : 

       1. ✓ https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/446
       1. ✓ https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/449
       1. ✓ https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/450
       1. https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/454

    a. update brial : https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24786

  A. make all doctests pass

    a. ✓ fix doctests in plot/plot.py : https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25579/

    a. fix doctests in src/sage/combinat/root_system/plot.py (involves https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25677 ; https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25724)

    a. ✓ fix pickling : https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24582/

    a. fix all doctests in parent and element :  one step in https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25824/

    a. fix all doctests of some touchstone files (for example src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py)

    a. fix all doctests of some core files (for example src/sage/rings/integer_ring.pyx)

2. monitor the progress : see https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26212

  A. estimate how many files still have doctest failures (524 in 8.4.rc0, with 6976 doctests failures) 

  A. tools to check for progress and prevent regression (any buildbot ?)

  A. enhance the patchbot "pyflakes" plugin : https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/issues/128

  A. patchbot doctests on sage3 : search for python3 reports in https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/
