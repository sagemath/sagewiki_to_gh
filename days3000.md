This is a small-scale workshop for Sage developers with a specific focus on porting
Sage to Python 3. While a lot of effort has been done for this,
we hope that this workshop will accelerate this.

== Organizer ==

 * Jeroen Demeyer (Ghent University)

== Participants ==

 * Frédéric Chapoton (CNRS &amp; Université de Strasbourg)
 * Jeroen Demeyer (Ghent University)

== Funding ==

For participants without travel grants, the [[https://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]] project has some money available.


== Some specific tasks ==
