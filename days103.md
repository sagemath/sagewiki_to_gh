These Sage days are a special event for women* who develop in <a class="http" href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> or wish to learn Sage. They will include introduction presentations, training,  and team work on specific projects. There is no initial knowledge needed, everyone is welcome whether they are new Sage learners or Sage expert. We believe in diversity in backgrounds and experiences. 


*This event is primarily targeted at women as to help form a team of women developers and to reduce the gap between men and women developers in Sage Math in particular and in open scientific software in general. It is for all who self identify as a woman.

## The event

The event will be workshop style. 

We will start the week by some introduction presentations and tutorials especially targeted at those who don't know much Sage. Then each project leader will present their mathematical and / or Sage project to the group. After that we will split into groups and work together on our projects. Groups can then share what they've accomplished and their next goals at the end of each day.
