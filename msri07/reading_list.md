= Preworkshop Reading Materials =

All participants at the MSRI Parallel Computation Workshop will be assumed to have a basic background in parallel computation already -- there will be no basic background tutorials or lectures.   Fortunately, anybody can get such a background in a day by reading the documents listed below under ''required reading''.

== Required Reading List ==

At a minimum, make sure you are completely familiar with the following before the workshop, in order:

1. [http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/parallel_comp/ Introduction to Parallel Computing]

2. [http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/pthreads/ POSIX Threads Programming]

3. [http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/openMP/ OpenMP tutorial]

4. [http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/mpi/ MPI Tutorial]

== Optional Reading List ==

1. [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2006-May/382955.html List post about OpenMp and Python]
2. [http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/search?query=parallel&x=0&y=0&section=PYTHONCKBK&type=Subsection Python Parallel Recipes]


== Other Relevant Documents ==

Skim or read these as time permits:
