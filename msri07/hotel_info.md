MSRI asks that you make your own accommodation arrangements, and we recommend that 
you do this as soon as possible, as rooms book up quickly in Berkeley.  
 
A block of rooms at the Hotel Durant has been put on hold by MSRI for your convenience. 
Please contact the hotel directly to make your reservation via phone: (510) 845-8981, or e-

Please visit www.msri.org/about/visitors/index_html for general information about visiting MSRI 
such as local maps, local transportation options and recreation opportunities. Both the 
workshop organizers and MSRI staff can be contacted by email at 410@msri.org, in case you 
have any questions. 
 
Many of MSRI’s short-term visitors receive travel reimbursement and/or per diem expenses. If 
you are not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, in order for MSRI to process your 
reimbursement forms you will need to present proper documentation to verify that you entered 
the U.S. in an acceptable visa status.  The tourist classification (B-2 visa or WT) DOES NOT 
allow for payment of any kind, including travel and expenses reimbursement.  
  
If you are a foreign national entering the U.S. from abroad, unless you are eligible for the Visa 
Waiver Program, you will need to apply for a Visitor Visa, B-1 business classification, which 
allows for short visits for usual academic activities such as workshops and for reimbursement of 
travel and local expenses. You need to obtain the B-1 designation on your I-94 card at the 
entry inspection.  If you are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, you must obtain the WB 
designation (Waiver for Business) on your I-94 card at entry. For more information about the 
B-1, Visitor Visa, as well as information on the Visa Waiver Program, please refer to 
www.msri.org/propapps/visa_information/index_html. 
 
If you are currently an international student or scholar at a U.S. institution, please be prepared 
to provide your passport and supporting visa documents for review. We will need to make 
copies of the following documents:  
 
• Passport biographical page 
• Visa stamp (unless waiver program participant or Canadian citizen) 
• Entry stamp from your passport 
• I-94 card 
• Supporting documents:  I-20ID (for F1 visa holders, pages 1-3 of the document) or DS- 
2019 (for J1 visa holders). J-1 Scholars/Professors should provide a letter from their J-1 
sponsor authorizing the visit and reimbursement if applicable. 
 
Reimbursement forms will be available during the workshop. We ask that you come prepared to 
pay for your lodging and other expenses. We will mail you a check a few weeks after we receive 
the completed reimbursement forms from you. Please note that the deadline for submitting 
reimbursement forms is February 16, 2007.
