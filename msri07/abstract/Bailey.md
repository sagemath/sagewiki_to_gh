Abstract:
 
Recent developments in "experimental mathematics" have underscored the value
of high-performance computing in modern mathematical research.  The most
frequent computations that arise here are high-precision (typically
several-hundred-digit accuracy) evaluations of integrals and series,
together with integer relation detections using the "PSLQ" algorithm.  Some
recent highlights in this arena include: (2) the discovery of "BBP"-type
formulas for various mathematical constants, including pi and log(2); (3)
the discovery of analytic evaluations for several classes of multivariate
zeta sums; (4) the discovery of Apery-like formulas for the Riemann zeta
function at integer arguments; and (5) the discovery of analytic evaluations
and linear relations among certain classes of definite integrals that arise
in mathematical physics.  The talk will include a live demo of the
"experimental mathematician's toolkit".
