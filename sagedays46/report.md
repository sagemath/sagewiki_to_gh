Final Reports from Participants:

* Vivek Venkatachalam <vivek@physics.harvard.edu>: I explored the
  possibility of adding vector-based (SVG) visualizations to Sage
  using the D3 framework.  This allows fluid, responsive interactive
  components to be generated by caching data on the client.  The
  output of this project involved preparing a demonstration of SVG
  line plots with a one-dimensional UI control and document-cached
  data.

* Xander Faber: familiarized himself with Benjamin Hutz's arithmetic
  dynamics code for computing rational preperiodic points for rational
  functions defined over Q. He then wrote new code for extending the
  local parts of the algorithm to the case of arbitrary number
  fields. What remains is to implement the lifting part of the
  algorithm via the Chinese remainder theorem.

* William Stein: I discussed the design of both interacts and the Sage
  Cell server with Jason Grout, and helped make it more scalable and
  highly available by deploying on multiple physical and virtual
  machines.  We discussed the design of SageMathCloud with
  participants, greatly improved the xterm functionality (adding
  resizing, font sizing, and color schemes), and I worked with Vivek
  on his D3-based visualization code.  I also wrote an %fork
  decorator, to enable easy async execution in a worksheet, and wrote
  a %exercise decorator on the flight home.

* Simon Spicer:
  Authored Patch 14189: Extend modular degree and congruence modulus
  of elliptic curves over QQ to arbitrary level.  Used code from the
  above patch to generate data to support formulation for conjectures
  relating to modular degrees and congruence numbers at higher levels.

  Reviewed the following number-theory tickets written by David Roe:
    Ticket 6567 -  Function to test whether or not some integer is a primitive root modulo n
    Ticket 12109 - Function for faster evaluation of cyclotomic polynomials
    Ticket 12116 - perfect_power for integers
    Ticket 14155 - gcd for IntegerMod
    Ticket 14193 - Converting polynomial quotient ring elements to PARI yields plain polynomials
  Started work on the following tickets:
    Ticket 12117 - Bugfixes and improvements to Aurifeuillian factorization
    Ticket 7240 - Factorization of Cunningham numbers - applications
    Ticket 12561 - Factoring p-adic polynomials


* Mirela Ciperiani: I worked on computing anticyclotomic p-adic
  heights and removing the uncertainty factor in the computation of
  cyclotomic p-adic heights of Heegner points.

* Michelle Mannes:
    (*) With Bianca Thompson: editing paper that grew out of Sage Days for Women 3 project on dynamics over finite fields.
    (*) With David Lukas (with lots of support from Aly): Learned how to create & upload a patch to Sage.  Made a small patch to how absolute_ideal works & uploaded it for review (#14212).
    (*) Reviewed patch #13130, sent comments to the author, then reviewed again (positive review, set to go in Sage 5.8beta3).
    (*) Reviewed patch #2217 (needs work).

* Alyson Deines and Ling Long: Ling and I wrote a function which takes
  square roots of q-expansions and used this compute coefficients of a
  weight one non-congruence modular form.  Based on work of Atkin and
  O'Brien, "Some properties of p(n) and c(n) modulo powers of 13" and
  the data, Ling was able to formulate two conjectures about the
  relationship of the q-expansion coefficients, which should be
  related to congruences between modular forms or p-adic modular
  forms.

* Jennifer Balakrishnan: At Sage Days 46, I studied how to
  characterize the first level of the anticyclotomic tower to remove
  the "highly likely" condition on our construction of Heegner points
  and their field of definition.  I also worked on computing a global
  anticyclotomic character from local data, as the first step to
  computing anticyclotomic p-adic heights on higher rank elliptic
  curves.

* Keith Clawson: I worked on setting up a high availability cluster to
  run the Sage cell server. I also worked on some systems
  administration tasks for the servers at UW.

* Kartik Venkatram: I was (and am still) working on putting NFS style
  factoring in sage. Several of the relevant libraries have been made
  into sage packages, and there are rudimentary functions to use them,
  but the main project is a class based approach which separates the
  polynomial searching, sieving, and linear algebra capabilities for
  separate use and optimization. Currently, the code is designed to
  use the binaries, but future work should wrap the c functions
  individually for greater versatility. The classes are inherently
  asynchronous, and use the underlying mpi of the nfs binaries for
  further parallelization.

* Volker Braun: I implemented and deployed a kvm-based script to keep
  long-running computations alive beyond OS restarts
  (https://github.com/vbraun/ImmortalSage). I also finished my rewrite
  of matrix groups, which now makes use of LibGAP. Finally, I added
  options to control the graphical display of polygons and wrote an
  enhancement for the resolution of lazy (delayed) imports.

* David Roe: I spent some time working on getting #12415 ready
  (including reviewing some dependencies: #14079, #14150, #14158).  I
  also worked on cleaning up a bunch of my old tickets (#6567, #14155,
  #12116, #12109, #12117, #12125, #7240) and getting them reviewed.
  Finally, I worked a bit on templating p-adics (#12555) and found
  some bugs in Sage's interface with PARI (#14082, #14193, #14194).

* Victoria DeQuene: I worked on getting my Jacobi theta series code
  ready for inclusion in Sage.  Code that previously used doubles now
  uses ints, and the code now works with Sage 5.7 (as opposed to
  4.0.2).  I also documented the main functions.  There is code posted
  at #14244 which should be ready for review soon.

* Jason Grout: I worked quite a bit with William and Keith on making
  the Sage Cell Server scalable and fault-tolerant, including writing
  a new database adapter and web server and setting up virtual
  machines with Keith and William to deploy load-balanced virtual Sage
  Cell Servers.  I also had long discussions with William about
  SageMathCloud and spent time getting more familiar with the current
  state of SageMathCloud.  I also worked a lot on understanding the
  similarities and differences between William's and my new interact
  implementations, thinking about the proper design of interacts, and
  fixed a major design problem with my implementation.  I also helped
  or had discussions in several other efforts, like Kartik's packaging
  of libraries into spkgs, and Vivek's work in D3 graphics.
