# Sage and cluster algebra workshop

The Sage and cluster algebra workshop will be held at the **University of Hannover, Germany, February 8-10 2012**. 


## Requirements

* Everyone attending should have a laptop with 
   * a Linux or Mac OS System (running one of OS X 10.4, 10.5, or 10.6). 
   * For those running Windows on their machines (if you do not understand what these things mean, Julian can explain the implications of these to you): 
         * you install Linux on your System 
         * or you try to get sage-combinat to work inside a "virtual machine" 
         * or use the Sage-Combinat server at <a href="http://sage.lacim.uqam.ca">http://sage.lacim.uqam.ca</a>. As this server is not completely reliable, this will not be the preferred way. 
* It would also be appreciated if everyone tries to install Sage and the optional Sage-Combinat package before the course starts. For instructions see <a href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/Installation">http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/Installation</a>. We will meet on Tuesday afternoon at 15:00 in the Leibniz Lab (IAZD's coffee room) to get sage installed on all the machines in some way. 
* Basic (or even a little more advanced) programming skills are not required but will be very helpful. 

## Further reading

* The Sage documentation <a href="http://sagemath.org/help.html#SageStandardDoc">http://sagemath.org/help.html#SageStandardDoc</a>. 
* Many thematic tutorials on Sage can be found at <a href="http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html">http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html</a>. 
* The compendium for the cluster algebra and quiver package <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4844">http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4844</a>. 
* For further references to background on cluster algebras and quivers see the references in the compendium.

## A tentative schedule

All sessions will be in the **IAZD Seminar Room (a410)**. 


### Wednesday Feb 8

On Wednesday, we will mainly go through several thematic tutorials that can be found at <a href="http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html">http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html</a>, plus a presentation on the history and current situation of Sage and Sage-Combinat.
