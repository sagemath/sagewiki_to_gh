= Sage and cluster algebra workshop =

The Sage and cluster algebra workshop will be held at the University of Hannover, Germany, February 8-10 2012.

== Requirements ==

 * Everyone attending should have a laptop with
  * a Linux or Mac OS System (running one of OS X 10.4, 10.5, or 10.6).
  * For those running Windows on their machines (if you do not understand what these things mean, Julian can explain the implications of these to you):
    * you install Linux on your System
    * or you try to get sage-combinat to work inside a "virtual machine"
    * or use the Sage-Combinat server at http://sage.lacim.uqam.ca. As this server is not completely reliable, this will not be the preferred way.
 * It would also be appreciated if everyone tries to install Sage and the optional Sage-Combinat package before the course starts. For instructions see http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/Installation. We will meet on Tuesday afternoon at 15:00 in the Leibniz Lab (IAZD's coffee room) to get sage installed on all the machines in some way.
 * Basic (or even a little more advanced) programming skills are not required but will be very helpful.

== Further reading ==

 * The Sage documentation http://sagemath.org/help.html#SageStandardDoc.
 * Many thematic tutorials on Sage can be found at http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html.
 * The compendium for the cluster algebra and quiver package http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4844.
 * For further references to background on cluster algebras and quivers see the references in the compendium.
 * Interesting lectures can be found at http://www.msri.org/web/msri/scientific/workshops/show/-/event/Wm550.

== A tentative schedule ==

All sessions will be in the IAZD Seminar Room (a410).

=== Wednesday Feb 8 ===

On Wednesday, we will mainly go through several thematic tutorials that can be found at http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html, plus a presentation on the history and current situation of Sage and Sage-Combinat.

==== 10:15-13:00 ====

 * Installing Sage and the optional Combinat package
 * Getting used to the Sage Notebook and the Sage command line
 * Using the documentation
 * How to get help
 * Using Sage and Sage-Combinat online

==== 14:15-17:00 ====

 * Some programming in Python and in Sage (which is based on Python)
 * Using the Computer Algebra System Sage

=== Thursday Feb 9 ===

==== 10:15-13:00 ====

 * First examples of the Cluster package and the interactive mode
 * Theoretical background
 * Working with finite and affine types
 * Connections to root systems and subword complexes

==== 14:15-17:00 ====

 * Exploring clusters for cluster algebras
 * The classification of finite and mutation-finite cluster algebras
 * Playing with the package

=== Friday Feb 10 ===

==== 10:15-13:00 ====

 * More theoretical background like the bipartite belt
 * Limits of the package
