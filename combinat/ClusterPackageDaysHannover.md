Sage and cluster algebra workshop
=================================

The Sage and cluster algebra workshop will be hold at the University of Hannover,
Germany, February 8-10 2012.

Requirements
------------

- I suggest that everyone attending uses laptop with

  - linux or mac os system.
  - If you happen to use Windows, you might be able to install Sage using cygwin, but I don't think it is possible to install the Combinat queue. In that case one can also use the Sage-Combinat server at http://sage.lacim.uqam.ca. As this server is not completely reliable, this will not be the preferred way.

- It would also be appreciated if everyone with linux or mac tries to install Sage and the optional Sage-Combinat package before the course starts. For instructions see http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/Installation.

- Basic (or even a little more advanced) programming skills are not required but will be very helpful.

Further reading
---------------

- The Sage documentation http://sagemath.org/help.html#SageStandardDoc.

- The compendium for the cluster algebra and quiver package http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4844.

- For further references to background on cluster algebras and quivers see the references in the compendium.
