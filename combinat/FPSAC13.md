* Monday morning-Wednesday morning: tutorial for newcomers and talks with a slant toward algebraic combinatorics

* Afternoons and rest of the week: coding sprints

* Thusrday 2pm-3pm: by a coincidence, the `Digiteo Seminar  <http://www.digiteo.fr/prochaine-seance-du-seminaire-digiteo-organisee-avec>`_ will take place in our conference room, with a
  distinguished lecture by Georges Gonthier on computer-checked proofs: Le génie mathématique, du théorème de quatre couleurs à la classification des groupes.

Newcomers are welcome to join later in the week;
there won't be specific events organized for them then, but we will be
available for questions and discussions while they get through
tutorials on their own or work on their personnal projects.

Access and directions
----------------------

The workshop will be held at the Faculté d'Orsay, in the `math department <http://www.math.u-psud.fr/acces.php>`_ in the
Petit Amphi of the Bâtiment 425. 

The **math department** is 45 minutes from Paris downtown by local trains (take the `RER B <http://www.ratp.fr/informer/pdf/orienter/f_plan.php?loc=reseaux&nompdf=rer_b&fm=gif>`_ from Charles de Gaulle or downtown Paris in the direction of St-Rémy-les-Chevreuse and get off at Orsay-Ville).
For more details see `directions <http://www.math.u-psud.fr/acces.php>`_ (in french). To purchase the train ticket, there are green machines that take credit cards or coins but no bills. The price to Orsay is 13 euros.

The closest RER station to the **hotel**: Residhome Bures La Guyonnerie is **Bures-sur-Yvette** (one station after Orsay-Ville) (see `map <http://goo.gl/maps/6VsP5>`_).

Here is a `map2 <http://goo.gl/maps/tdWM2>`_ with points of interest (Math department, Hotel, grocery store, restaurants) 

The math department is a five minute walk from the hotel (see below).

Depuis Paris, prendre le RER ( ligne B ) en direction de St-Rémy-les-Chevreuse, et descendre à Orsay-Ville. Se diriger vers le bas de la vallée. On peut alors continuer à pied jusqu'à l'entrée principale de l'Université, puis suivre le sentier qui remonte, jusqu'au fléchage indiquant le bâtiment 425 vers la gauche ( voir le plan en cliquant ici ). Il est également possible de prendre le bus 06-07 ( voir le circuit du bus ) jusqu'à l'arrêt "Château", et suivre le fléchage à partir de là.

(From Paris, take the RER (line B) to St-Remy-les-Chevreuse and get off at Orsay-Ville. Proceed down the valley. We can then continue on foot to the main entrance of the University, then follow the path back until signs indicating the 425 building to the left (see map here). It is also possible to take the bus 06-07 (see circuit bus) to stop "Castle", and follow the signs from there.)

Projects
--------

The wiki page for the projects and coding springs is available `here`__.

Registration
------------

Participation is free. To register,
please fill in `this poll <http://framadate.org/3p4vprml76v9r3vz>`_ so
that we can plan ahead for rooms, coffee breaks, ... and also to
optimize the lodging. Please send us your e-mail address as well so
that we can get in touch with you as the workshop gets closer.

Lodging
-------

We have negociated a reduced price at the nearby
`Residhome Appart Hotel from Bures-sur-Yvette <http://www.residhome.com/reservation1-residence-hoteliere-aparthotel-buressuryvette-183.html>`_.
The rate is of 66€ per night (56€ 5 nights or more) for a two person
studio (double bed or twin bed). There is also a reduced rate of 106€
(90€ for 5 nights or more) for a four person apartment (two double
beds; probably not so convenient). Breakfast is not included; see the
web site for the amenities.

To reduce the expenses you are strongly encouraged to find a room mate
to share a double room with. In particular, for those person that will
get funding from us for lodging, we will most likely reimburse on the
basis of 33 euros per night in order to support more participants.

To reserve a room, please send them an e-mail at
*bures.guyonnerie@residhome.com* or call *+33 1 64 86 36 00*. Mention
that you come for the "Sage Days 49 conference". If you want to share
a twin room, mention it and specify who your room mate will be.

*Caveat: there are only a limited number of rooms with twin beds, and
they will run out soon*. Therefore you are urged to reserve your room
as soon as possible.

Funding
-------

For participants coming from universities in the United States, there
is funding from our Sage-Combinat NSF grant. Please email Anne
Schilling (email anne at math.ucdavis.edu) with your CV and an estimated budget. The deadline
for this is March 30,
2013. Later applications will be considered as long as funds are
available.

If you were promised NSF funding, then please send the filled out `form 
<http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/FPSAC13?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=Travel_expense_report+fillable_09.pdf>`_
along with the original receipts to Jessica Goodall at

Jessica Goodall, Department of Mathematics, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616 or by e-mail to
jgoodall@math.ucdavis.edu .

Why 49?
-------

Because that's `7^2 <http://wiki.sagemath.org/days7>`_


Why Orsay?
----------

“Be grateful you’re not in the forest in France

Where the average young person just hasn’t a chance

To escape from the perilous pants eating plants

But your pants are safe, you’re a fortunate guy

You ought to be shouting how lucky am I”


-- Dr. Seuss, Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?
