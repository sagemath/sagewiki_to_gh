== Implement a generic FactoredElement class ==

PEOPLE: Burcin Erocal

  In many combinatorics applications we work with rational functions whose numerator/denominator factor into nice components where the factorization is also known beforehand. The current representation of rational functions in Sage use the expanded form of the numerator and denominator. The goal is to implement a generic wrapper to store elements in a factored representation.
