== Implement a generic FactoredElement class ==

PEOPLE: Burcin Erocal

  In many combinatorics applications we work with rational functions whose numerator/denominator factor into nice components where the factorization is also known beforehand. The current representation of rational functions in Sage use the expanded form of the numerator and denominator. The goal is to implement a generic wrapper to store elements in a factored representation.

== An example of adding a new basis to an algebra ==

PEOPLE: Franco Saliola

  This should be a nice exercise in adding a new basis (the seminormal basis) to an algebra (the group algebra of the symmetric group). We don't even have to introduce any new code to construct the basis since it already exists in Sage, thanks to Mike Hansen. On the other hand, I do have a better implementation based on a method that Alain Lascoux explained to me, so we could use that instead.
