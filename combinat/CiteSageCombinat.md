If you used Sage-Combinat non trivially for your research, we would appreciate acknowledgments in the resulting documents (articles, books, ...) using the standard citation below. This citation is anonymous but it is strongly suggested, in the acknowledgement section of the document, to cite Sage and Sage-Combinat, and to name explicitly the developers who worked on the specific features used in the publication, and/or cite the relevant articles (don't hesitate to ask on <a class="https" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-combinat-devel">sage-combinat-devel</a>). 

For example, 
```txt
This research was driven by computer exploration using the open-source
mathematical software \texttt{Sage}~\cite{sage} and its algebraic
combinatorics features developed by the \texttt{Sage-Combinat}
community~\cite{Sage-Combinat}, and in particular {{ names and
further citations}}.
```
See the wiki page to <a class="http" href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/Publications_using_SAGE">cite Sage properly</a>.
