== Sage Days 64.5 ==

 * Minneapolis, June 1-5, 2015
 * Version 15-01-26

The starting point is the core implementation of cluster algebras as merged in Sage-5.9, see [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10298|#10298]], with possible new features discussen in spring 2013 in Minneapolis.

=== Topics ===

 Topics and goals for the week will be discussed the first day of the workshop. Below is a list of possible topics:

==== Important features ====

 * Allow labellings of the vertices of quivers and cluster seeds (i.e., provide a dict that contains this information, and which is used all over to work with cluster seeds)
    
 * in some situations, it might be nice to update variable names. E.g., for PlÃ¼cker coords and SL[N].

 * generalized associahedra from cluster complexes (Christian) - http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10817

 * Check why variable_class() is so much slower compared with cluster_class().  This might be because Laurent polynomials are slow in sage. (Christian)

 * Finish the implementation of finite reflection groups (Christian) -- trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11187

 * Allowing options to work with g-vectors, d-vectors, c-vectors directly rather than with cluster variables

==== Other features ====

 * Scattering diagrams (visualization and algebraic computations of broken lines)

 * Quantum cluster algebras

 * Generalized cluster algebras

 * Visualize ideal triangulations

 * Exotic Belavin-Drinfeld cluster algebras or cluster algebras from Double Bruhat Cells

 * Urban Renewal

 * more on Quiver Representations?

==== Other features, easy ====

 * Include new Quiver mutation types for Gale-Robinson Quivers (Gregg) - http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14444

 * Add sum of quivers/cluster seed as disjoint union (Christian/Gregg) - http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14443

 * Include new Quivers/cluster seed for square and triangular products of quivers (as in Keller's work on periodicity) (Christian/Gregg) - http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14443

 * Implement snake graph / matrix multiplication formulas for cluster algebras from surfaces and friezes. (Gregg) - http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16310
 Also see Dupont's sage code on friezes from http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~dupontg/files/strings.sage 

==== Other features, hard ====

 * Finish mutation type checking for affine D_n (try to dove-tail with student describing all affine B/C/etc. quiver types)

 * Allow inputs of cluster algebras from surfaces (interface from ideal triangulations/bistellar flips as from John Palmeri or Robert Lipshitz) (Gregg?) - look at http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipshitz/research.html#Programming

 * Work with the improved graph editor (once it exists?)

 * Weiwen Gu Decomposition algorithm - and then use this to classify cluster algebra from surface by genus, number of marked/boundary points, etc. (Emily/Al/Gregg)

 * Quantum cluster algebras - with Dylan Rupel

 * Work with cluster algebras as "algebras" and find bases or express elements in bases 

 * d-vectors (using inductive formulas from Cluster Algebras IV?)

 * Jim Starx code for Quiver Representations and abilities to work with Auslander-Reiten translates, etc. ([[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12630|#12630]])

 * LP algebras (Thomas Lam and Pasha Pylyavskyy with Gregg?)

 * Q-system and T-system calculations as in Di Francesco and Kedem's work

=== Changes to the compendium ===

 * Convert the compendium into an rst file and provide it as a thematic tutorial.

 * Change intro to describe downloading only sage >= 5.9

 * Adding F-polynomials, G-vectors, C-vectors, etc. updates to principal_extension/restrictions, ...

 * Mutation type names (eg. V, W, ...) need to be updated

 * Generalized associahedra from cluster algebra in new ticket so that compendium accurately discusses these features

 * check if all class sizes are correct - see [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14048|#14048]] by Hugh Thomas and Frederic Chapoton

 * cut out groups_of_mutations() and probably other names need to be deleted or updated
