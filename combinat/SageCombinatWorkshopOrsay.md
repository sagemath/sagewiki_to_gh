= Sage-Combinat workshop in Orsay =

Week of 26-30 of January 2009

3-4 days depending on the last minutes constraints of the participants.

Purpose: work on the foundations (Hopf algebra infrastructure, ...) and get former MuPAD-Combinat developers on board

== Suggested Topics ==

Add topics that you want discuss or work on. Add your name next to anything you'd like to participate with. Your name should at least appear next to the topics you suggest :-)

 * '''Words''' -- Improvements to the words code, discussions regarding the trac #5002, finish and post words_new_fct_sl.patch to trac. (FrancoSaliola, Sébastien Labbé)
 * '''NCSF''' -- Mike Zabrocki sent me an implementation of noncommutative symmetric functions in Sage. I'll have it with me at the meeting to share and discuss. (It's not on the patch server because he finds the instructions complicated, which brings me to the next point.) (FrancoSaliola)
 * '''Patch Server Guide''' -- Write a better guide for the patch server. It's currently way too long, and a shorter, concise version would be better. (FrancoSaliola, Sébastien Labbé)
 * '''Posets''' -- the posets code in Sage needs to be re-designed to integrate properly with the rest of sage-combinat (FrancoSaliola).
 * '''Set Partition (with no s)''' -- Implement Set Partition as a child of Set Partitions. Use the code from Disjoint Set which is already in the sage-combinat tree (Sébastien Labbé).
 * '''Word Paths''' -- Final improvements to word paths, get the patch posted to trac and reviewed. (Sébastien Labbé).
 * '''Dyck Word''' -- Discussions about getting Dyck Words inherits from Word Paths. Comparisons of efficiency. (Sébastien Labbé).
 * '''Desosseur''' -- Computing the Cartan invariant and more generally representation theory of finite dimensional algebras (FlorentHivert).
