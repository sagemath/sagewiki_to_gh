= Sage-Combinat and Chevie workshop in Orsay =

June 14-18 of 2010

Purpose: strengthen the collaboration between Sage and Chevie, in
particular around Coxeter groups and Hecke algebras

Sponsored by the Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay, Université Paris Sud {{attachment:logo_UFR.png|Faculté d'Orsay|width=100}}

== Accommodation ==

Like for the previous [[http:/combinat/SageCombinatWorkshopOrsay|Sage-Combinat days of January 2009]], I (Nicolas) have rented a 8-person house in Cernay-la-Ville
([[http://www.cernayvacances.com/CFrans.html|la tour]]). In case of overflow, we can setup tents in the adjacent garden.
We will do the cooking ourselves (bring your favorite recipes and dishes!). Altogether this will make for a tight budget.

== Program ==

The first day of the conference (Monday 14th) will take place in
Orsay, bâtiment 425, and is open to anybody wanting to learn about
[[http:www.sagemath.org/|Sage]].

 * 10am-11am, petit amphi: An introduction to Sage (Nicolas M. Thiéry)
 * 11am-1pm, (Salle Info Grand Amphi(20)), tutorials
 * 1pm-2pm, lunch

Here are the different slides and worksheet:
