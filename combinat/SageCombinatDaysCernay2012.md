Sage-Combinat days in Orsay, January/February 2012
==================================================

FlorentHivert: I'm thinking about organizing a small one-week Sage-Combinat coding
sprint around January-February in the south-west of Paris. 

Following the \*-Combinat tradition I plan to reserve the `guest house the tower <http://www.cernayvacances.com/CEngels.html>`_  at Cernay-la-Ville.
It is very nice and cosy, 35 minutes train + 15 minutes bus away from
downtown Paris. It can accommodate 8-10 people, and if needed there is
another adjacent guest house.

Here is a tentative list of themes:

 * Refactoring of the combinatorics infrastructure (factories, Cythonizing partitions, compositions...)

 * Cythonization of many iterators

 * Categories (Morphisms, functorial constructions, optimization, coercion ?)

 * Integration of more Sage-Combinat thematic tutorials into Sage

 * Please expand!

We haven't yet secured a funding, but if it is likely that we will be
able to cover the local expenses (lodging + food).

So my questions are the following:

 *  who is interested ?
 *  what is the preferred week ?

Please fill in `this poll <http://nuages.domainepublic.net/cd7d/vote/>`_.

Martin Albrecht : I am interested, but I cannot commit to any dates yet. I definitely cannot do 16.-20.1. and 20.2.-24.2. Anyway, I suggest you pick your dates and I'll try to make it at least for one day? I can't help with combinatorics much, though.

Viviane Pons : very much interested, available mostly in February (6-10, 13-17, 20-24, ...)

Jean-Pierre Flori : Interested as well. I don't think I'll be able to attend the whole week, but two or three days should be ok. I'd better avoid the last week of January, first of February if possible. As far as the topics are concerned, I'd love to have a deeper look into the coercion system and its caching mecanism to get a better understanding of it and to solve bug #715. If anyone is interested, we could also have a look at some symbolic issues in pynac (which could be of interest for combinat people).

We would love to have some hard core Cython and/or Sage developer at
hand :-)
