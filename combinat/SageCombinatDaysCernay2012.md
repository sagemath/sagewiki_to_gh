Sage-Combinat days in Orsay, January/February 2012
==================================================

FlorentHivert: I'm thinking about organizing a small one-week coding
sprint around January-February in the south-west of Paris. Following
the \*-Combinat tradition I plan to reserve the guest house at
Cernay-la-Ville:

    http://www.cernayvacances.com/CEngels.html (the tower)

It is very nice an cosy, 35 minutes train + 15 minutes bus away from
downtown Paris. It can accommodate 8-10 people, and if needed there is
another adjacent guest house.

Here is a tentative list of themes:

 * Refactoring of the combinatorics infrastructure (factories, Cythonizing partitions, compositions...)

 * Categories (Morphisms, functorial constructions, optimization, coercion ?)

 * Integration of more Sage-Combinat thematic tutorials into Sage

 * Please expand!

We haven't yet secured a funding, but if it is likely that we will be
able to cover the local expenses (lodging + food).

So my questions are the following:

 *  who is interested ?
 *  what is the preferred week ?

Martin Albrecht : I am interested, but I cannot commit to any dates yet. I definitely cannot do 16.-20.1. and 20.2.-24.2. Anyway, I suggest you pick your dates and I'll try to make it at least for one day? I can't help with combinatorics much, though.

Viviane Pons : very much interested, available mostly in February (6-10, 13-17, 20-24, ...)


We would love to have some hard core Cython and/or Sage developer at
hand :-)
