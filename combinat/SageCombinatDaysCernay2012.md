= Sage-Combinat days in Orsay, January/February 2012 =

FlorentHivert: I'm thinking about organizing a small one-week coding
sprint around January-February in the south-west of Paris. Following
the *-Combinat tradition I plan to reserve the guest house at
Cernay-la-Ville:

    http://www.cernayvacances.com/CEngels.html (the tower)

It is very nice an cosy, 35 minutes train + 15 minutes bus away from
downtown Paris. It can accommodate 8-10 people, and if needed there is
another adjacent guest house.

Here is a tentative list of themes:

- Refactoring of the combinatorics infrastructure (factories, Cythonizing partitions, compositions...)

- Categories (Morphisms, functorial constructions, optimization, coercion ?)

- Integration of more Sage-Combinat thematic tutorials into Sage

- Please expand!

We haven't yet secured a funding, but if it is likely that we will be
able to cover the local expenses (lodging + food).

So my questions are the following:

 - who is interested ?
 - what is the preferred week ?

We would love to have some hard core Cython and/or Sage developer at
hand :-)
