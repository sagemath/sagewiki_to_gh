= Language and tilings =

This page gathers ideas for refactorization of sage.combinat.words and a creation of a class for tilings. A word (in the way they are considered in Sage) should be considered as particular case of tilings. The two main notions which coexist with some generality are : tiling generated by local rules (subshift of finite type) and tiling generated by substitution rule (morphic word, adic systems, ...).

generic definition : A ''tiling'' is a map from an enumerated set to an alphabet. A finite word is a word for which the enumeration set is an interval of integers (?), an ''infinite word'' ? a ''bi-infinite word'' ?

== Structure ==

=== Tiling space ===
The highest level class should be something like TilingSpace. It contains an enumerated set, an alphabet (and optionally a way of plotting). Do we always assume that the enumerated set is either a group (like ZZ^d) or a sub-semigroup of a group (like NN^d) ?

=== Tiling and words ===


=== Factor, equality ===
By going from ZZ to ZZ^2 or more general groups, the notion of factor is not well defined. It depends of some shape. In ZZ we take integers interval
