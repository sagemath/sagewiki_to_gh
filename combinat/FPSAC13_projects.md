Project list for Sage Days 49: Free and Practical Software for Algebraic Combinatorics
======================================================================================


Please edit and add your projects!

 1. Combinatorial Species (Martin Rubey, Thursday and Friday only):

  * code cleanup

  * generation of unlabelled objects for composition and functorial composition via a group action framework

  * multisort species (multivariate formal power series would be useful for that)

  * add code by Andrew for Gamma-species

  * support operations from symmetric function code for cycle index series

 1. Conclude (add last docs, and make output depending on wether the command is launched from the command line or the notebook) and submit OEIS patch (ThierryMonteil)

 1. Finish CFF review (ThierryMonteil)

 1. Trac-ify some of the bugs found via ask.sagemath.org and discuss about better integration between those two useful tools (ThierryMonteil)

 1. Work on making RIF and CIF more reliable (ThierryMonteil)

 1. Add parallel cloning to [http://sagedebianlive.metelu.net/ Sage Debian Live] USB key (ThierryMonteil)
