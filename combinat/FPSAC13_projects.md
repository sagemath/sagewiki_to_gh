======================================================================================


Please edit and add your projects!

1. Combinatorial Species (Martin Rubey, Thursday and Friday only):

  * code cleanup

  * generation of unlabelled objects for composition and functorial composition via a group action framework

  * multisort species (multivariate formal power series would be useful for that)

  * add code by Andrew for Gamma-species

  * support operations from symmetric function code for cycle index series
