This page will survey open source computer algebra systems (OSCAS's). Some of this may appear as columns in [[http://www.acm.org/sigsam/bulletin/|CCA]].

A ''computer algebra system'' (CAS) is a mathematical software package capable of symbolic manipulation.  The commercial CAS industry is big business. Few people know more about the CAS industry than {{{Darren McIntyre}}}, VP of Worldwide Sales at Maplesoft. He estimates the worldwide yearly expenditures on computer algebra (buying licenses, employee salaries, and so on) is at least $ 600 million. Clients include not just students and universities, but diverse industries who often find that a CAS is a convenient programming environment to model industrial problems.

Omitted is ''CAFE'' (Computer Algebra and Functional Equations),  a group writing a collection of CAS libraries  (see  [[http://www-sop.inria.fr/cafe/main-e.html|CAFE]]). They appear to be written in Aldor and Maple by (the late) Manuel Bronstein. I (=David Joyner) cannot determine the license (if any)  they are released under. I am also unsure if the  "open source" licenses of LiDIA, MAS, and Scilab are compatible with the above-mentioned open source definition. Several of these are under very active development and some of these are essentially dead. Two other sources of information are the Computer algebra handbook [[[#references|GKW]]] and the internet sites [[[#references|CA]]].

In any case, we see from this table that there are a lot of open source computer algebra systems out there. Some of these are special purpose (such as Symmetrica) and others are general purpose (such as Axiom).
