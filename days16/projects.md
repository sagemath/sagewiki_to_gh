== Create a Cython class for points on elliptic curves and optimize basic arithmetic ==

  Right now basic arithmetic on elliptic curves is way too slow.  It could be sped up by moving the point class to Cython, and possibly by using better formulas for arithmetic, e.g., using projective coordinates.
