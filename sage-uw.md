 * Wed, March 1, 5-6pm: Jim Morrow -- '''Algorithms for Discrete Electrical Networks'''
       ABSTRACT: I will present algorithms for recovery of information about discrete electrical networks.  Time permitting, I'll also  discuss algorithms for embedding graphs in Riemann surfaces.

Things Martin Albrecht may talk about during his visit:
{{{
Hi everybody, 
 
this is a list of stuff I could talk about. I didn't think those through, just 
stuff that came to mind.
 
 * Pyrex/SageX (I know e.g. Robert Miller wants to start hacking Pyrex to 
    speed up the graph stuff)
 * Wrap up of what happened at the MSRI workshop
 * Algebraic attacks on block ciphers and Groebner bases in SAGE 
 * 
}}}


Fridays 4-5pm in C401, at least -- probably more frequently!

 * Friday, Jan 19 (at 4pm): William Stein -- SAGE 2.0

 * Friday, Jan 19 (at 5pm): William Stein -- Tutorial introduction to using SAGE for the Modeling Contest (etc.)
  
 * Friday, Jan 26: Andrey Novoseltsev: ''PALP''
    PALP is a Package for Analyzing Lattice Polytopes, written by Maximilian Kreuzer and Harald Skarke during their work with reflexive polytopes, that appear in connection with toric varieties, Calabi-Yau manifolds, and string theory. It contains several command line applications written in C, is quite small and fast. Recently is was included into standard distribution of SAGE, together with lattice_polytope.py module that uses some of its functions. 

    I will talk about PALP itself, functions and structure of lattice_polytope.py module, and directions for improvement/development.
