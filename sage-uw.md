Things Martin Albrecht may talk about during his visit:
{{{
Hi everybody, 
 
this is a list of stuff I could talk about. I didn't think those through, just 
stuff that came to mind.
 
 * Pyrex/SageX (I know e.g. Robert Miller wants to start hacking Pyrex to 
    speed up the graph stuff)
 * Wrap up of what happened at the MSRI workshop
 * Algebraic attacks on block ciphers and Groebner bases in SAGE 
 * Options for fast multivariate polynomial arithmetic in SAGE (CoCoALib, 
    Singular, specialized implementations)
