* SAGE-Maxima interface 

* SAGE-GAP interface

* SAGE-Singular interface

* Brainstorm about how a "SAGE Foundation" will work during SAGE Days. 

  * Some ideas:

   1. News announcements (say to local/campus newspapers). I (=wdj) send out a
   GAP newsletter. It's a pain and sometimes I think a waste of time but a few people
   really appreciate it and think it is great. The Foundation could be
   responsible for such things. University administrators read the local/campus
   papers and it does not hurt to just inform people of what is going on,
   especially when it is of general interest.

   2. I'm talking informally with various people about preinstalling SAGE on
   all (approx 1200) freshman PCs next year at the USNA. In this case, an official
   organization might be helpful. Also, it would be nice if a windows test
   suite was available (beyond the "sage -testall"). Something like a short
   list of tasks to check that the Notebook is working properly, for example.
   If a single person is installing, then sage-suport is fine. If a college
   or organization is installing or using SAGE for somethign, a Foundation
   might be more appropriate.

   3. Funding for using SAGE in teaching could go through the SAGE foundation.

   4. I (=IftikharBurhanuddin) would like to see *more* developers involved in SAGE. We are currently understaffed and the thinking that a good chuck of users will contribute to the dev-SAGE is wishful. These people should ideally have good systems/hacking experience (not necessarily mathematicians/computer scientists) who will help dekink the kinks (in lesser time) than our amateurish efforts. The way this fits into the Sage Foundation is the question of funding for Sage.

   5. The Foundation could produce videos of using SAGE to explore/teach such-and-such a topic. These could run the gamut from general ("SAGE in number theory") to specific ("Fourier series of periodic functions using SAGE").
