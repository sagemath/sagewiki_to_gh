= Sage Developer Coding Week 1 =
ORGANIZERS: William Stein, Robert Bradshaw

DATES: June 13-20, 2008

The goal of this "developer coding week" will be to write a huge amount of high quality code.  All talks will be squarely aimed at developers and be directly related to coding projects.  All participants will assumed to be very experienced programmers. The main topics will be: Cython, Exact Linear Algebra, Parallel Computation, and Porting Sage to Windows.   However, like with all of Sage development, participants are encouraged to work on whatever they feel will be the ''most productive'' way for them to spend their time.

Anybody can participant, but funding will be aimed primarily at people who have demonstrated a substantial ability to contribute to the Sage project.  (This is not a general Sage statement -- it's just for this workshop.)

LOCAL:

 * Tom Boothby
 * Robert Bradshaw
 * Josh Kantor
 * Emily Kirkman
 * Robert Miller (June 13-20)
 * Bobby Moretti (?)
 * Clement Pernet
 * Yi Qiang
 * Dan Shumow (?)
 * William Stein (June 13-20) -- everything, but especially exact linear algebra
== Main Topics ==
 * Cython -- something much deeper than usual, and not necessarily so Sage related.  Cython is one of the "killer apps" of Sage:
  * expand range of Cython developers (i.e., Robert tells us how to work on Cython).
  * increase documentation
  * future development directions
  * PEX
  * pickling
 * MS Windows -- figure out how to do a full native port of Sage to Windows. Seattle would be a good place for this theme, and I'm working on getting some Microsoft funding to support doing a port.
  * visiting Microsoft and meeting the clients
  * finish the cygwin part
  * teach everyone how to use MSVC
 * Parallel computation in Sage -- DSage, Ipython1, Threads again; sort of like the MSRI conference last year but much more focused on Sage and actual implementations.
 * Exact linear algebra -- perfect to capitalize on Clement Pernet being around, and the positive momentum behind Linbox, IML, etc.  There would be a number of talks on all the basic tricks of exact linear algebra, systematic benchmarking, with the goal being to "beat Magma" at a range of exact linear algebra problems.
== Dates you could come ==
(this was for organizational purposes...)

 * William Stein: any dates during June 13 - June 22, July 3 - July 6.... (I'm now going to ISSAC July 20-23 too).
 * Michael Abshoff: pretty much any date except July 20–23, i.e. ISSAC 2008
 * Martin Albrecht: most dates should be fine after June 14 until August 17 (CRYPTO)
 * Marshall Hampton: Only great dates for me are July 13 - 18th; my summer is very tightly scheduled.  I will try to make any weekend date.
 * Craig Citro: Anything after July 4 works great for me.
 * Jason Grout: May 19 - May 23; June 23 - June 26; July 28 - Aug 15
 * David Roe: May 24-June 25, August 18-Sept 9
 * Emily Kirkman: June 13 - June 22
 * Clément Pernet: any date except July 7-11 (SIAM meeting in San Diego), and maybe July 20-23 (ISSAC), although not sure I'll go there.
 * Mike Hansen: any dates at this point
 * Burcin Erocal:
 * David Harvey
 * Bill Purvis: any dates at this point (retired systems engineer)
