See the [[uw-local-info|local info]] page for more about staying at the Collegianna, in particular procedures about after-hours keycard pickup, which is available anytime the office is not open.  This will all be paid through the University of Washington, you do not need to pay for your room.  But please pay careful attention to Collegiana's procedures for checking out.

   * 2012/05/15 Budget, $119, northeast of campus, about a 1 mile walk.
   * 2012/05/15 Sold-out for Friday, May 15, but you could get a room at the (more expensive) Silver Cloud for one night, it is only about a block away.
   * 2012/05/16 $109.
   * 2012/05/16 Expedia for about $80/night.

Another option is to stay in the "Belltown" neighborhood, just north of downtown and about 4 miles from campus.  Search for hotels near the intersection of "3rd Avenue and Bell Street" and consider the #71, #72, #73 buses departing from 5th & Pine to go out to campus.
