Dates are the '''nights''' notebook developers require lodging.  Please do not edit this section.

'''2012/05/15 Some dates are not exact - just placeholders until I have better information. And room assignments may change'''

See the [[uw-local-info|local info]] page for more about staying at the Collegianna, in particular procedures about after-hours keycard pickup, which is available anytime the office is not open.  This will all be paid through the University of Washington, you do not need to pay for your room.  But please pay careful attention to Collegiana's procedures for checking out.
