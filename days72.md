'''Organizers''': Daniel Krenn, Štěpán Starosta

Location: Prague, Czech Republic

== Focus & Topics ==

=== Introduction and Tutorial for Beginners ===

=== Automata and Digit Expansions ===

Automata and transducers are available in !SageMath via its [[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.html|finite state machines module]]. The introduction of this package will focus on examples related to digit expansions.

=== Using SageMath in number system research ===


=== Experimenting with SageMath ===

The presentation will cover some experience collected while using SageMath as a tool to help in research and teaching. We will also shortly present the Julia language and compare it with SageMath.
