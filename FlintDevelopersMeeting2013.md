See <a href="/spkg/flint">spkg/flint</a> There will be a meeting for development of FLINT (<a href="http://flintlib.org">http://flintlib.org</a>) between May 4-12, 2013 at Warwick University in Coventry in the UK. 

This workshop will be a good opportunity to work on Sage wrapper code for the new functionality provided in flint-2.3. Relevant tickets include: 

* <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12173">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12173</a> (Update FLINT to 2.3, in case it has not already been closed by then!) 
* <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14304">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14304</a> (New implementation of unramified p-adics using FLINT and templates) 
* <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13199">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13199</a> (Use FLINT to compute the partition function) 
Some possible collaboration topics for FLINT itself include: 

* LLL in flint 
* polynomial factorisation in flint 
* linear algebra in flint 
* ball arithmetic in arb (a new library by Fredrik Johansson based on flint) 
* finite fields in flint 
* C++ wrapper for flint 
* algebraic number theory in flint 
* integer factorisation in flint 
* using flint to compute symmetric Hilbert modular forms
