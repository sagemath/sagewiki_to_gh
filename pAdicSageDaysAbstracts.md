== Arithmetic aspects of triangle groups (John Voight) ==

Triangle groups, the symmetry groups of tessellations of the
hyperbolic plane by triangles, have been studied since early work of
Hecke and of Klein--the most famous triangle group being SL_2(ZZ).  We
present a construction of congruence subgroups of triangle groups
(joint with Pete L. Clark) that gives rise to curves analogous to the
modular curves, and provide some applications to arithmetic.  We
conclude with some computations that highlight the interesting
features of these curves.

== The divisibility of the Tate-Shafarevich group of an elliptic curve in the Weil-Chatelet group (Mirela Ciperiani) ==

In this talk I will report on progress on the following two questions, the first posed by
Cassels in 1961 and the second considered by Bashmakov in 1974. The first question is
whether the elements of the Tate-Shafarevich group are infinitely divisible when considered
as elements of the Weil-Chatelet group. The second question concerns the intersection of
the Tate-Shafarevich group with the maximal divisible subgroup of the Weil-Chatelet group.
This is joint work with Jakob Stix.
