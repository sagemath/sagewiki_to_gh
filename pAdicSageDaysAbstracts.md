<<Anchor(Buhler)>>
== Stable p-adic recursions (Joe Buhler) ==

Michael Somos and Lewis Carroll found, respectively, one (circa
1990) and two dimensional (circa 1866) recursions that, unexpectedly,
generate integers and satisfy the so-called Laurent phenomenon.
David Robbins observed that the Carroll recursion seems to have an
unexpected stability over DVRs when computed with finite precision.
This conjecture seems to apply to the Somos recursions and to the much
more general context of cluster algebras.  I'll explain how some special
cases of these conjectures can be proved, discuss some techniques for
p-adic experiments on these conjectures, and explain how the conjectures
can be reinterpreted in an entirely algebraic context that generalizes
the Laurent phenomenon.  This is joint work with Kiran Kedlaya.

<<Anchor(Stein)>>
== Computing p-adic L-functions of elliptic curves (William Stein) ==

Tuesday 11:00-12:00

<<Anchor(Greenberg)>>
== Definite quaternion algebras and triple product p-adic L-functions ==

An extremely useful formula of Ichino expresses central values of
triple product L-functions in terms of trilinear forms evaluated on
specific test vectors.  I will discuss joint work with Marco Seveso in
which we show that, in the "definite case,"  these trilinear forms can
be p-adically interpolated, giving rise to triple product p-adic
L-functions.

Tuesday 13:00-14:00

<<Anchor(Voight)>>
== Arithmetic aspects of triangle groups (John Voight) ==

Triangle groups, the symmetry groups of tessellations of the
hyperbolic plane by triangles, have been studied since early work of
Hecke and of Klein--the most famous triangle group being SL_2(ZZ).  We
present a construction of congruence subgroups of triangle groups
(joint with Pete L. Clark) that gives rise to curves analogous to the
modular curves, and provide some applications to arithmetic.  We
conclude with some computations that highlight the interesting
features of these curves.

<<Anchor(Ciperiani)>>
== The divisibility of the Tate-Shafarevich group of an elliptic curve in the Weil-Chatelet group (Mirela Ciperiani) ==

In this talk I will report on progress on the following two questions, the first posed by
Cassels in 1961 and the second considered by Bashmakov in 1974. The first question is
whether the elements of the Tate-Shafarevich group are infinitely divisible when considered
as elements of the Weil-Chatelet group. The second question concerns the intersection of
the Tate-Shafarevich group with the maximal divisible subgroup of the Weil-Chatelet group.
This is joint work with Jakob Stix.
