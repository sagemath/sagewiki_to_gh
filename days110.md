[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops|SageDays]] are gatherings of people interested in SageMath, from newcomers to contributors. Sage Days have been organized as local, regional, or international in-person meetings by a wide range of people around the globe.  Because of the current global health crisis, we organize SageDays 109 as the first fully virtual event in the series.

== About SageMath ==

[[https://www.sagemath.org/|Sage]] is a mature, comprehensive, free (open-source) mathematics software system based on Python, licensed under the GNU General Public License, that integrates computer algebra facilities and general computational packages. 

Sage, first released in 2005, in over a decade of incubation in the  [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs|SageMath distribution, comprising 293 software packages]], has grown its own [[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage|library of 1000 Cython and over 4400 Python modules]], ranging from `sage.algebras.*` over `sage.geometry.*` to `sage.tensor.*`, with a total of over 2.2 million lines of code.  

[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.0|SageMath 9.0]], released in January 2020, completed the transition of the Sage library to Python 3.
