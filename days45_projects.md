Sage Days 45 Coding Sprint Projects
===================================

This is the project page for `Sage Days 45 <http://icerm.brown.edu/sp-s13?quicktabs_16=1#quicktabs-16>`_, and more generaly ICERM's
semester on `Automorphic Forms, Combinatorial Representation Theory and Multiple Dirichlet Series <http://icerm.brown.edu/sp-s13>`_.

Below is a list of proposed projects.

- Implementation of extended affine Weyl groups, affine Iwahori Hecke algebras, and nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. This project was started during Sage Days 40 by Dan Bump, Dan Orr, Anne Schilling, Mark Shimozono and Nicolas Thiery and preliminary patches are in the sage-combinat queue (see extended_affine_weyl_groups_sd40.patch and affine_iwahori_hecke_algebras.patch).

- Finalization of the coxeter3 integration into Sage. This would bring a faster implementation of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials to Sage. See `Trac Ticket 12912 <http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12912>`_ .

- Quantum Schubert products in general types (in particular type C) for the full flag variety (Liz Beazley)

- For the Grassmannian computing quantum equivariant Schubert products (Liz Beazley)
