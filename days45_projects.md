Sage Days 45 Coding Sprint Projects
===================================

This is the project page for `Sage Days 45 <http://icerm.brown.edu/sp-s13?quicktabs_16=1#quicktabs-16>`_, and more generaly ICERM's
semester on `Automorphic Forms, Combinatorial Representation Theory and Multiple Dirichlet Series <http://icerm.brown.edu/sp-s13>`_.

Below is a list of proposed projects. You are welcome to add more
projects or add yourself as participant for existing projects! The
following `feature request guidelines <feature_request_guidelines>`_
may help you specify useful and realistic project descriptions; if you
are at ICERM, you are more than welcome to come discuss about those
with the Sage fans there!

Extended affine Weyl groups, affine Iwahori Hecke algebras, and nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials
==================================================================================================

Bump, Schilling, Shimozono, Thiéry

This project was started during Sage Days 40 by Dan Bump, Dan Orr,
Anne Schilling, Mark Shimozono and Nicolas Thiéry and preliminary
patches are in the sage-combinat queue (see
extended_affine_weyl_groups_sd40.patch and
affine_iwahori_hecke_algebras.patch).


Finalization of the Coxeter3 integration into Sage
==================================================

Schilling, Thiéry

This would bring a faster implementation of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials to Sage.

See `Trac Ticket 12912 <http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12912>`_.

Further Kazdhan-Lusztig functionalities
=======================================

Brant Jones


Quantum Schubert products in general types (in particular type C) for the full flag variety
===========================================================================================

Liz Beazley

Equivariant puzzle rule
========================

Liz Beazley, Anne Schilling

Review the `root system plot ticket <http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/4327>`_
======================================================================================

Thiéry

Finalization of the `partition options patch <http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13605>`_
================================================================================================

Travis Scrimshaw and Andrew Mathas

Crystals and `rigged configurations code <http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13872>`_ and dependencies
=============================================================================================================
