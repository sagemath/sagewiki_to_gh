== Tentative Participants ==

 * Salman Baig

 * Gebhard Boeckle: "For me some time between May 17 to June 5 would be good. [I give a lecture series in Barcelona form June 14-June 25, so June 5 is the very latest, the activity in Seattle would need to end.]"

 * Craig Citro

 * Chris Hall

 * Kiran Kedlaya: "The one week I might be able to make it is June 7-11. Not that I can guarantee my attendance if you do schedule it that week, but at least I'm interested and I don't have an apparent conflict like I do with the weeks around it."

 * Steven J Miller: "I am interested whenever it may be. Our finals end on May 24, graduation is June 5-6; however, I can find someone to cover for me if needed."

 * William Stein

 * Doug Ulmer: "May is pretty open for me, the best dates being roughly 5/10-21.  Earlier is possible.  It gets much more complicated after that and impossible after Memorial Day."

 * Felipe Voloch: "I'm currently free May-June and August-December 2010."
