=== Housing ===

A handful of visitors will be staying at the Shuey House, while the remaining visitors have rooms on hold for them at [[http://www.hoteldeca.com|Hotel Deca]] (4507 Brooklyn Avenue NE, Seattle, WA 98105). The tentative housing arrangement is as follows:

==== The Shuey House ====

 * Second floor ([[http://www.shueyhouse.com/second%20floor.jpg|layout]])
  * Master suite bedroom: K. Wilson and S. Miller
  * Bedroom 2: J. Balakrishnan
  * Bedroom 3: C. Hall
  * Bedroom 4: F. Hess

 * Third Floor ([[http://www.shueyhouse.com/thirdfloor.jpg|layout]])
  * Bedroom 1: G. Moehlmann, R. Butenuth
  * Bedroom 2: T. Occhipinti, H. Brown

==== Hotel Deca ====

 * G. Boeckle
 * B. Conrey
 * D. Ulmer
 * F. Voloch

=== Getting to the Shuey House/Hotel Deca from Seattle-Tacoma ===

Here are some options to get to the Shuey House or Hotel Deca from the airport:

 * [[http://www.yelp.com/biz/a-abc-transportation-seattle#hrid:keLb-JbNNBPNxcvoGUwIOQ/src:search/query:car%20service|A-ABC Transportation]] offers a flat rate ($30 typically, before tip) for door-to-door car service. I (Salman) have used them multiple times, and they are my preferred transportation to/from the airport if I'm traveling by myself. They are a private car service (though they don't have the nicest fleet of cars) and are less expensive than a cab. Call 206-242-0102 for a reservation.
 * Taxis from the airport cost about $40 (before tip) and can be found by following the signs in the airport.
 * [[http://shuttleexpress.com/seatac-airport/default.aspx|Shuttle Express]] picks up passengers at the inner curb on the third floor of the Airport Garage. Call 425-981-7000 to make a reservation.
 * There is a new light-rail service from the airport to downtown Seattle, but you will then need to take a taxi to the house/hotel (about 5 miles north of downtown). This is not a good option unless you want to spend time in downtown Seattle.

=== Getting Around ===

Both the Shuey House and Hotel Deca are close to the UW campus as well as plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, etc. You will find that you can walk to nearly anything you like from the house or hotel, so a car is probably unnecessary. If you do plan on renting a car, please let me (Salman) know, and I will provide you information on parking, getting to/from the hotel, etc.

Seattle also has a well-connected [[http://metro.kingcounty.gov/|bus]] system, which can be used if you want to get out of the University District and explore the rest of the city. Talk to Craig or Salman if you have any questions about riding the buses.

=== Map ===

Here's a Google [[http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=103028083620229012626.00048318482c1f79ef823&ll=47.662107,-122.307487&spn=0.008946,0.015814&z=16|map]] with the major locations marked.

This is a [[http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html|campus map]] that shows the location of Padelford (the Math department) and Savery and Thomson Halls (where talks on Monday will be).
