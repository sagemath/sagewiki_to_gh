==  Introduction ==

The SAGE Graph Theory Project aims to implement Graph objects and algorithms in ["SAGE"].

The main people working on this project are Emily Kirkman, Robert Miller and Bobby Moretti.

== Current Status ==

 * We are currently seeking feedback on our [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_survey survey] of existing graph theory software.
 * We hope to begin the initial [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_benchmark benchmarks] this week.  These will deal mostly with construction / storage / retrieval and basic algorithms.
 * On Friday, October 20th Robert Miller will be giving a talk in PDL C-401 at 4:00pm. The talk will cover what we found for existing graph theory software, as well as some implementation issues. The first round of benchmarking should also be finished by then, the results of which will be shared. There will also be a short discussion of graphs  in an abstract mathematical context.

== Wiki Pages ==

=== Survey of Existing Software ===
 * [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_survey Link]
 * We have attempted to make a complete list of existing graph theory software. We posted functionality lists and some algorithm/construction summaries. We are very interested in feedback!
=== Benchmarks ===
 * [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_benchmark Link]
 * Our initial tests are designed to compare the constructions and very basic functionality found in our survey of existing software. At this stage in the game, we are testing to find the best way to represent graph objects in SAGE.
 * We will post results on the wiki as we get them. And as always, we love feedback!
