==  Introduction ==

The SAGE Graph Theory Project aims to implement Graph objects and algorithms in ["SAGE"].

The main people working on this project are Emily Kirkman, Robert Miller and Bobby Moretti.

== Current Status ==

 * We are currently seeking possible additions to our [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_survey survey] of existing graph theory software.
 * The initial [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_benchmark benchmarking] has proven that ["NetworkX"] is the solution for SAGE.
 * On Friday, October 20th, Robert Miller gave a [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/rlmill/talk_2001-10-20/2006-10-20SAGE.pdf talk] about the state of affairs for existing software which shared a few benchmarks and discussed some implementation ideas.
 * Emily Kirkman (and soon Jason Grout (Brigham Young)) is working on a database of well-known graphs.
 * Robert Miller has wrapped the basic functionality of NetworkX into SAGE's Graph class, and implemented plotting of graphs.
 * Jim Morrow has expressed interest in using SAGE for his summer REU on graphs. Robert Miller is currently working on implementing some of the algorithms of this group.
 * Chris Godsil (Waterloo) has expressed interest in helping design a more general discrete math package in SAGE, including perhaps an open source version of nauty.

== Wiki Pages ==

=== Survey of Existing Software ===
 * [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_survey Link]
 * We have attempted to make a complete list of existing graph theory software. We posted functionality lists and some algorithm/construction summaries. We are very interested in feedback!
=== Benchmarks ===
 * [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_benchmark Link]
 * Our initial tests are designed to compare the constructions and very basic functionality found in our survey of existing software. At this stage in the game, we are testing to find the best way to represent graph objects in SAGE.
 * We will post results on the wiki as we get them. And as always, we love feedback!
=== Plotting ===
 * [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_plotting Link]
 * So far: NetworkX graphics primitive
=== Database ===
 * [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_database Link]
 * So far: Basic graph structures with intuitive graphics
 * Plan:  Extensive educational docstrings and many, many more graph constructors
=== Survey of Existing Database Software ===
 * [http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/graph_db_survey Link]
 * I've found some resources, but please recommend...
