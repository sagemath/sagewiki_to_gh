==  Introduction ==

The SAGE Graph Theory Project aims to implement Graph objects and algorithms in ["SAGE"].

The main people working on this project are Emily Kirkman, Robert Miller and Bobby Moretti.

== Current Status ==

 * We are currently seeking feedback on our survey of existing graph theory software.
 * We hope to begin the initial benchmarks this week.  These will deal mostly with construction, retrieval and basic algorithms.
 * On Friday, October 20th Robert Miller will be giving a talk in PDL C-401 on graph theory and optimal algorithms.  The talk is at 4? 5?  Somebody that knows the correct time should put it in...
