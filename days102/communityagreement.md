Our event is committed to creating a  professional  and  welcoming  environment  that  benefits  from  the diversity of experiences of **all** its participants.  We will not tolerate any  form  of  discrimination  or  harassment.   We  aim  to  offer  equal opportunity and treatment to every participant regardless of their mathematical experience, programming experience, gender identity, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, or any other factor. 

Behavior or language that is welcome or acceptable to one person may be  unwelcome or offensive to another.   Consequently,  we ask  you  to  use  extra  care  to  ensure  that  your  words  and  actions communicate  respect  for  others.   This  is  especially  important  for those in positions of authority or power, since individuals with less power have many reasons to fear expressing their objections regarding unwelcome behavior. 

If a participant engages in discriminatory or harrassing behavior, Women In Sage organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling them from the event. If you are being harassed, you feel uncomfortable with the way you  are  being  treated,  you  notice  that  someone  else  is  being  harassed,  or  you  have  any   other  concerns,  please  contact  the organizers E. M. Bray (<a href="mailto:erik.bray@lri.fr">erik.bray@lri.fr</a>) or Viviane Pons (<a href="mailto:viviane.pons@lri.fr">viviane.pons@lri.fr</a>).
