== Rough Overview: no dollar figures, just *what you want*, e.g., summer salary, quarter buyout. ==
 * Jason Grout (let me know if I'm being too ambitious here, since I have zero experience with writing NSF grant proposals)
   * Summer salary for the duration of the grant
   * support for several (2-3?) students for summer or year-round projects
   * travel for me and possibly students involved to conferences to talk about all of this (e.g., Mathfest, Joint Meetings, etc.)
 * Rob Beezer
   * Already have release unit for Spring 2010, will likely produce Sage primer for rings, fields, Galois Theory in undergraduate abstract algebra course.
   * Have a semester sabbatical for Fall 2010 (or could be Spring 2011).  Another semester's leave would extend this to a full academic year for Sage-related activities.
   * Very possible the second semester could be funded through a competitive program at my university.  I will also be applying for travel funds.  Applications are due early October, should know result before this grant proposal is due.
   * So, a semester's buyout (if not awarded internally) would be the first priority, otherwise summer support to complement the academic year leave, and in future summers during the grant.
   * Travel support for MAA meetings and Sage Days.
 * Mini-grants for faculty to write curriculum materials (textbooks/course notes/tutorials/interacts) using Sage.  Maybe a few thousand dollars each?  A summer salary, or a one-course buyout for a semester?
 * Summer workshops for each year after the first for faculty to write curriculum materials using Sage, i.e., Sage !EduDays :)
    * Regional workshops--there are a lot of smaller schools in Iowa, for example.  It might be viable to invite people from smaller schools in the area.  Also, there are lots of faculty in universities in the Southeast U.S. from schools with large minority populations that were exposed to Sage at AIM; maybe a regional conference there would be a big hit.
    * National workshops (via AIM, if appropriate?)--invite people from all over

== Detailed Budget: Exact Dollar Amounts ==

Below, talk to your secretaries and find out exactly how much what you want will really cost. 

 * William Stein: 
    * 4 Months Summer Salary: $
    
 * Jason Grout:
    * funding through university
    * 6 months summer (2 mos x 3 summers): 5400x6 = $32400 + overhead (30%?) + whatever yearly increases are needed
    * Travel support - MAA meetings, Sage Days, etc.--2000/year: $6000

 * Rob Beezer:
    * 6 months summer (2 mos x 3 summers): 21856 + 22293 + 22961 = $67,110
    * This is actual salary, until I understand indirect costs, etc.
    * Travel support - MAA meetings, Sage Days, etc. = $6,000

 * Tom Judson: 
    * Summer 2010: Prepare the abstract algebra textbook for integration with Sage, work with Sandra Laursen  and Marja-Liisa Hassi to prepare detailed evaluation plan, work on the educational research component. (1 month at @ $6675 = $6675)
    * Summer 2011: Work on the abstract algebra book with Rob, continue to work on the evaluation and educational research components (2 months @ $6675 = $13,350)
    * Summer 2012: Finish the evaluation and educational research components (0.5 months at @ $6675 = $3337.50)
    * Total Budget Request:  $23362.50

 * Undergraduate Students
    * William -- 4 parttime undergraduate employees: $12K/year
    * Jason -- 2 summer students, paid through AIM (at whatever the usual rate and hours worked is): (3 years)(2 months)(2 students) = 12 student-months
    * Jason -- 1 part-time student during the academic year, paid through AIM at the normal rate/hours worked: (3 years)(1 student) = 3 student-years (academic years)
    * Travel money for students to go to meetings about Sage: ???

 * Two Sage Edu Days:
    * $12K/each

 * AIM Dissemination
    * See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-grants/browse_thread/thread/581889719a14be28/
    * David Farmer "$10K/year in seed money"

 * Test Drivers
    * Faculty (N=?) who use Sage, and materials we create, in a course
    * Stipend for a useful final report - $1000 (??)
 
 * Subject-Specific Guides
    * Rob, Jason:  \$5,000?  One month summer salary?  One course buyout (runs \$12,000 at UPS.)
    * William:  2 weeks work, $2000
    * Number of these (per year)?

 * Support for Evaluation, Education Research
    * Tom once said $30,000? 

 * Improve Sage Infrastructure, emphasizing improving the educational experience
    * William has about $68,000 of good ideas (exclusive of subject guides) [[attachment:stein-ideas.pdf]]
