Each of the original sections of NSF's message has a list of questions, which is followed by a subsection where we can list ideas about responses.  Please precede your response by a name and date.

= Engagement with related projects =

  * There are a number of projects related to the SAGE effort, e.g. the
  MAA's "MathDL Books Online" project led by Lang Moore, see award number:
  0231083; the "Connexions" project at Rice University led by Rich
  Baruniak, see http://cnx.org/; and the "Holistic Numerical Methods
  Institute" led by Autar Kaw, see
  http://numericalmethods.eng.usf.edu/index.html. What possibilities do
  you see to engage in synergistic activities (e.g. in content, expertise,
  shared technology, etc) with these efforts?

== Responses ==
  * (RAB, 6/30) David and Rob have already been speaking with Connexions
  as part of a related project and have a good rapport with (two names here) Kathi Fletcher and Joel Thierstein.

  * (RAB, 6/30) Jason - do you have an article prepared for Math DL with Karl-Dieter?
  Anything you can add here?

  * (JG, 6/30) Karl-Dieter, Byungchul, and I have an outline for an article for LOCI that is somewhat fleshed out.  We put it aside to deal with PREP, but now Karl-Dieter has brought up the article again.  It's very unlikely to get done in the next two weeks, but the editor is looking forward to the article, so there is communication and working together.

= Engagement w/other institutions =

  * A number of reviewers wanted to see more information about
  implementation efforts at other schools. For example, "PIs could have
  strengthened the proposal by addressing institutionalization efforts at
  participating colleges and universities if implementation is successful"
  and "I would have rated this proposal higher if it had included
  commitments from the seven additional institutions." In sections 5.3.1
  and 5.3.2, the proposal narrative does set out a useful description of
  the activities and selection criteria. But beyond the three institutions
  with whom you have already secured commitments to test out the
  implementation of SAGE, what other institutions have you contacted and
  who will you work with at each?

  * How do you plan to ensure that a diverse set of institutions will be
  involved? Are some of these HBCUs or MSIs? What about two-year colleges?
  What timetable for bringing these institutions on board do you envision?
  Please supply appropriate letters of interest, if not commitment to
  participate.

== Responses ==
 * (RAB, 6/30)  Clearly this was a big one to have not gotten right.
  * Maki led Jason and I to think a few firm examples would be superlative.
  * I think it is wise to invite schools in two waves, as we said.
  So we could stick to that?
  * Tom has suggested we might round out the first group with firm commitments.
  * HBCU = "Historically Black Colleges and Universities"?  But what is a MSI?
  * Do we need to reiterate CalSate Dominguez Hills' enrollment profile?
  I'm sure Pong could dig up more info for us.
  * Estelle Basor (AIM) was telling me in San Franciso about a 
  minority-mathematician-educator group interested in Sage.  
  Might be a good place to look for more test sites.  Can't find my exact notes at the moment.
  * Letters of interest:  I have emails from David Joyner (Westpoint), Dana Ernst (Maine), 
  Dan Drake (Korea), all with various Sage involvement already.  Also emails from Edgar 
  Jasso (Seattle-area Community College), Erin Martin (Westminster C, Missouri), 
  Jared Schlieper (Armstrong Atlantic, Georgia). 

 * (JG, 6/30) [[http://www.math.txstate.edu/people/faculty/dean.html|Nate Dean]] (president of [[http://www.nam-math.org/|NAM]]) has been introduced to Sage and was excited about it.  He might be a great resource for finding HBCU schools.


= Project details and management =


  More than one reviewer expressed concern that the proposal had outlined
  perhaps an overly ambitious agenda:  "However, the breadth of the
  proposed activities, in the absence of additional supporting detail for
  how the activities will be accomplished, raises some concerns." Or, "I
  am concerned about the many initiatives the project proposes."

  * What does the team envision as the relative balance of effort among
  the different implementation components laid out in section 5?

  * What is the scope and nature of the production of non-text-based
  materials? How comprehensive a set of materials does the project
  envision, e.g. are these suites of general visualizations that can be
  used in a wide variety of settings? What other types of materials are
  planned?

  * Please clarify the roles and responsibilities of project team members
  as they are connected to the primary goals, objectives, and tasks of the
  project.  It would also help greatly if these activities are mapped to a
  timeline.

  * What types of members of the Editorial Board do you envision?  What
  expertise and experience do you see are appropriate? Who has already
  agreed to serve, and how will you recruit others?

== Responses ==
 * (RAB, 6/30)
   * Looks we need to be more specific about the "library of interacts", etc.
   The new infrastructure in Sage for this might help reinforce the
   dissemination, availability, ease of use.
   * We need a timeline!
   * "Editorial Board" - this is one for AIM it appears.

= Evaluation =

  In general the panelists saw the proposed evaluation efforts as solid,
  however questions remain. For example: "The PIs present data to support
  the fact that large numbers of people are creating accounts online, but
  details to indicate how they are using the accounts and an assessment of
  the impact of prior efforts on student learning would have strengthened
  the proposal." And "There was some thought that more details of the
  assessment of student learning from the Phase 1 activities should have
  been included in the current Phase 2 proposal."

  * The types of questions posed at the beginning of section 6 are fine,
  but can these be "sharpened" to go beyond just descriptive (What and
  How?) towards the explanatory (Why?) Please provide some examples of
  these more probing questions the project team would ask and how you
  might collect data or otherwise make observations that would help answer
  these kinds of questions.

  * One direction of this kind of inquiry was suggested by a panel member
  who asked about connecting the evaluation and assessment work to
  research efforts about the use of dynamic textbooks.  Is this reasonable
  and how might the evaluation group go about investigating this?

  * One of the important benefits of the Sagebooks environment is that
  materials may not only be reused, but also revised and adapted by
  others.  From that starting point, are there ways the project can
  observe user behavior more deeply? For example, can modifications be
  tracked, contributions recorded, etc. What about capturing and analyzing
  network interactions among participants? What does the social graph look
  like and how does it change and why? Is growth in student understanding
  somehow observable through changes in how students use the materials and
  interact with the faculty and/or their peers?

== Responses ==
 * (RAB, 6/30)
   * The social graph question looks like it came from NSF.  If modifications
   are contributed back to open-souce textbooks they can be tracked with Mercurial.
   Tom and I are using this now with his book.
   * We've talked about "observing" student use (misuse) in a Sage worksheet as
   a way for an instructor to learn more about student behavior.  Way out of
   scope, but maybe worth responding positively about its potential.

= Technology issues =

  * You'll have seen that several reviewers commented on wanting to see
  more detail regarding the Sage server infrastructure, both current and
  projected. For example, "A concern would be the actual purpose of the
  Sage servers and their on-site implementation. More information should
  be given about what impact this will have on actual usage of the
  implementation." Or "The capabilities of the Sage server were
  unclear---is the current software sufficient to meet the needs of a
  moderate to large campus using these on-line texts?" Please clarify
  these points.

  * What statistics are available regarding installations of SAGE? Can the
  "nature" of such installations be tracked? I am thinking here of things
  like: locations, growth over time, distribution over time, the usage
  data at each installation, etc.?

  * What is the cost for a site to set up a SAGE server to provide access
  locally? (Note: the implementation cost is related to questions that
  follow regarding broader impact and affordability.)

== Responses ==
 * (RAB, 6/30)
   * I think we want to say that sagenb.org cannot alone, in its current state,
   serve as THE global Sage server.  Conversely, a single machine could certainly
   service a department at a large school, or an entire small campus.  Maybe
   this isn't accurate?  (Jason, William?).  But in any event, I think this
   is what we want to discover.  If we plop down dedicated hardware, with
   "tech support," can a school/department use Sage reliably?  Where is
   the line on number of accounts serviced?  How much support is required?
   How can the notebook be improved?  What should documentation say for
   those who want to roll-their-own installation (perhaps outside of
   official channels)?

  * (JG, 6/30) - I think Rob is correct that a single machine should be able to serve an entire small campus, at least initially.  I hope to have up to 100 simultaneous users on the Drake sage server with 16G of RAM and two quad-core processors (it seemed to serve several small classes with just 4G of RAM).  Certainly a single machine like that could serve an instructor's classes for the purposes of the grant.

= Dissemination/Impact =

  * How will the system to allow textbooks to be converted to this on-line
  format be assessed? Will the larger-scale adoption of texts developed in
  this context be assessed (as compared with other similar texts, etc.)?
  Please respond.

  * The panel also sought to understand whether "the use of AIM as an
  'established authority' to vet the texts will be sufficient to motivate
  large-scale adoption."  Please respond.

  * There was also concern that: "dissemination appears to be largely
  focused on colleges and universities with more resources." However,
  reviewers did recognize that the project has an intent to engage
  two-year colleges and under resourced institutions among the test sites.
  Please clarify how the dissemination plan expects to undertake reaching
  a broad audience of potential users.

  * Some panelists also wondered about the appeal of the open-source texts
  beyond the existing community. For example, in the panel summary
  reviewers wrote: "A final question raising concerns about broader impact
  was whether the open-source textbooks being developed would be (or even
  could be) appealing by those outside of the existing Sage community."
  While NSF does share enthusiasm for open-source approaches, the concern
  raised by reviewers is legitimate. What are the potential barriers to
  broader adoption that the project has identified and how does it propose
  to address these?

== Responses ==
 * Start here.

= Budget =

  * One panelist had "major reservations" that release-time was not
  clearly budgeted for the teacher-authors who will implement, develop and
  assess the modules of the online interactive texts. Please clarify this
  question.

  * There was confusion regarding how provisioning the remote use of Sage
  would be handled. Is this through an in-kind contribution of server time
  and maintenance at the University of Washington, or is the intent to
  request grant funds to install new servers at participating
  institutions?

  * The above question is related to concern that broad adoption is
  dependent on the capacity for adopting institutions to host an
  installation of Sage locally and bear those long-term costs, or whether
  sufficient capacity exists centrally to allow many remote users spread
  across participating institutions. If more server capacity must be
  implemented (and this could take the form of either central improvements
  or greater resources brought to bear at each site), are there
  adjustments to the originally proposed technology expenditures that are
  better spent in this way, then on their initially proposed purposes?
  Please respond.

== Responses ==
 * (RAB, 6/30)
   * Reiterate stipends for summer preparation.  Could we allow them to be
   used to finance a release unit if possible?

= Additional Notes =

  * A couple of the institutions that are part of this collaborative
  submission indicated on their respective cover sheets that Human
  Subjects Approval was in the process of being sought. We will need to
  receive the appropriate documentation that this approval has been
  granted by the relevant Institutional Review Boards. The best thing to
  do here is to have that signed approval (on the school's letterhead)
  scanned as a PDF and e-mailed directly to me.

  * Our overall CCLI budget for math remains tight so we are trying to
  support as many projects as we can. Therefore we would like to see if
  you could explore some potential cost savings in your budget. We think
  we can get up to a figure of $525K. Where you would find adjustments to
  make would be entirely up to you and your team. If this is doable and I
  hope it is, you'll need to submit a revised budget and include a "budget
  impact statement" that describes what if any impact the reduction would
  have on the scope of the project. I realize that with a collaborative
  submission, you will need to work with your collaborators. But it would
  be up to you though as to where you would look for the savings. It may
  mean that all of the partners will need to submit revised budgets, but
  it would be fine if you chose to do this only with a subset of your
  group. Again, it is your call here.

== Responses ==
 * RAB (6/30)  I can start on Human Subjects, but wonder if we will see
 results and what paperwork is needed?

 * RAB (6/30)  One idea for budget savings.  Drop back to 4 schools per
 year.  Less ambitious.  Saves $10,000.  Rob, Tom, Jason could each 
 serve as a contact to two schools and William and Kiran could do one each.

 * JG (6/30) I agree that cutting back to 4 schools per year is a good idea.  Maybe even 3 the first year and 5 the second year to give us some more time at the beginning to ramp things up?  That would solve the "didn't get more letters from schools" issue too.
