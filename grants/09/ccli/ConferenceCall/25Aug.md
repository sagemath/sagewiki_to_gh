CCLI, deadline January 13, 2010


== NOTES: August 25, 2009 ==

Names of 10 experts -- not too closely involved in sage but *want it*:
     * Nate Dean

Ideas: 
     * Textbooks using Sage
     * Tie in with moodle

Tom Judson, names:
    * Kathleen Hide at Penn State did a lot of early work with mathematica
    * Janette Palmittor at Oregon state who did a lot

------

What people would do if we get the grant:

 Rob Beezer -- has sabatical, wants external funding for second semester
    * "converting textbooks to be Sage enabled" 
    * "sage integrated into textbook"
    * "view textbook within sage notebook"
    * "high quality typography"
    * "read/experminent/demonstrate ideas"
    * "tinymce to annotate your copy of the book"
    * "tom judson's open source algebra (?) book.  used by 4-5 schools, including berkeley, BU, etc."
    * "sage primer on group theory came out of the book"
    * "moodle integration"

 Jason Grout --
    * "polish Sage functionality to make it"
    * polish up, polish up.   
    * the last 10% to be really consistent and unified for undergrads
    * linear algebra, graphing, graph theory (pretty polished + robert miller's fast graphs)
    * wide range of things to polish and document better
    * tutorials
    * standalone version local GUI that would interact with notebooks that
      use enthought's stuff: mayavi
    * 3d interacts
    * local fast 3d interacts -- Kiran speaks to how useful it would be to 
      have this in teaching. 

* David Farmer -- do not use the word polish -- use the phrase "classroom ready"!!

* William Stein:
    * geogebra embedding (only 2d)
    * david farmer: what we need is library of useful stuff that user
      can use to get going during teacher.
    * evaluation capabilities built into sage

-----

Technical things, beyond year one.

   * David Farmer -- how will people make their books available online?

Recruit people to put books online in year two.

Rob Beezer: People would need some *guidance*.

Some discussion about the breadth of CCLI type 2...

Tom Judson -- so we will collect ideas, implement accross several
universities, sell and tie under one umbrella.

It's all about computer use in the classroom, but integrated with
entire all-online experience.  We are provided the tools to widely
implement this.

David Farmer: We are beyond "pilot". 

Rob Beezer: Campus wide server, easier, authentication builtin to
that, make it trivial to setup.

Jason Grout: Having a windows port will make a huge difference.

-------

Budget: no dollar figures, just *what you want*, e.g., summer salary,
quarter buyout.

Next week: 10am next Wednesday
