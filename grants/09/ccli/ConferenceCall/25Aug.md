CCLI, deadline January 13, 2010


== NOTES: August 25, 2009 ==

Names of 10 experts -- not too closely involved in sage but *want it*:
    * Nate Dean
    * Michael Gage/Michael Pearson (webwork)?

Ideas: 
     * Textbooks using Sage
     * Tie in with moodle

Tom Judson, names:
    * Kathleen Hide at Penn State did a lot of early work with mathematica
    * Janette Palmittor at Oregon state who did a lot

------

What people would do if we get the grant:

 Rob Beezer -- has sabatical, wants external funding for second semester
    * "converting textbooks to be Sage enabled" 
    * "sage integrated into textbook"
    * "view textbook within sage notebook"
    * "high quality typography"
    * "read/experminent/demonstrate ideas"
    * "tinymce to annotate your copy of the book"
    * "tom judson's open source algebra (?) book.  used by 4-5 schools, including berkeley, BU, etc."
    * "sage primer on group theory came out of the book"
    * "moodle integration"

 Jason Grout --
    * Make Sage "classroom-ready" (i.e., polish up, polish up)
      * the last 10% to be really consistent and unified for undergrads
      * linear algebra, graphing, graph theory (pretty polished + robert miller's fast graphs)
      * wide range of things to polish and document better
      * tutorials
    * standalone version local GUI that would interact with notebooks that use enthought's stuff: mayavi, chaco, etc.
      * local responsive 2d/3d graphics interacts using matplotlib/chaco/mayavi -- Kiran speaks to how useful it would be to have fast 3d interacts in teaching. 
    * notebook input widgets (like Rado's graph editor, a matrix input widget, etc.) that work in the input cells

* David Farmer -- do not use the word polish -- use the phrase "classroom ready"!!

* William Stein:
    * geogebra embedding (only 2d)
    * david farmer: what we need is library of useful stuff that user
      can use to get going during teacher.
    * evaluation capabilities built into sage -- system for gather information about how Sage is being used and other feedback.

* Campus wide server, easier, authentication built-in to that, make it trivial to setup.

* Library of interacts included in Sage

-----

Technical things, beyond year one.

   * David Farmer -- how will people make their books available online?

Year 2:

  * Recruit people to put books online in year two.

  * Recruit people to make other classroom material (e.g., interacts) and contribute them in year 2.

Rob Beezer: People would need some *guidance*.

Some discussion about the breadth of CCLI type 2...

Tom Judson -- so we will collect ideas, implement across several
universities, sell and tie under one umbrella.

It's all about computer use in the classroom, but integrated with
entire all-online experience.  We are provided the tools to widely
implement this.

David Farmer: We are beyond "pilot". 

Jason Grout: Having a windows port will make a huge difference, if it is possible and fits well within this grant.  

William: The Cygwin port might be done soon and would fill the need of a windows port for most students.

-------

Budget: no dollar figures, just *what you want*, e.g., summer salary,
quarter buyout.

Next week: 10am next Wednesday
