   * What is evaluation? 
   * Long discussion about evaluation, and plan to have Tom Judson 
         * contact Sandra Laursen, who has extensive experience already evaluating other CCLI's.  303-735-2942; <a href="mailto:sandra.laursen@colorado.edu">sandra.laursen@colorado.edu</a> 
   * Discuss the timeline (Jason leads) 
            * William: make it look more like engineering Lots needed to spring sage onto public. Judson: How do we get Sage into classroom of non-Sage people. "ABC Junior College". How to get them using usage in a pre-calculus course? Jason: we start by finding out *what* the barriers are during the first year. Sage get used outside our textbook.  Subject specific tutorials.   We aren't doing a calc book, but Sage could be used in calculus.  Books:  
                           * linear algebra 
                           * combinatorics 
                           * number theory 
                           * maybe multivariate calculus 
                           * ? There are a lot of candidates... David: distinction between books produced internally versus books coming from workshops.      People who have approached us -- get pushed off to workshops.  
      * Add my book to the timeline  
      * Remark: many people can work on notebook (funded) 
      * "combinatorics" --> "discrete mathematics" (includes number theory) 
      * dynamic layout of the widgets in an interact.  
      * grading system for grading a collection of worksheets; there is 
            * an anecdote here!  William -- design this.  Imagine doing this this and this and don't worry about the technical obstacles. 
      * Dissemination: Tom is very optimistic that we can do this well. 
      * There will be problems getting sage out there that we can't even 
            * imagine, and they will be major problems.   Methods:  
                     * ask people 
                     * _partner_ with people and help them, get feedback, modest stipend; this is assessment and evaluation.   
                     * get this working in the first year can save us big problems later on 
                     * people in discussion groups: excited about sage, just got 
                           * sage, want to use it in my class.  Recruit exactly these people. then get feedback from them.      
                     * Hey, we will provide you support!  "I would just love it." 
                     * We will also give you a stipend if you write up a report at the end, etc. 
                     * "Sign me up!" 
                     * Get stipend not for using sage, but for writing the report.  David Farmer: How we initiate this contact.   Say in the proposal exactly how we get this.   Name names.   Mailing list?  Any other way to get people?     Kiran: run minicourse at AMS meeting, then advertise that they could participate in this program.  Etc. 
      * Jason: goes over year 2 
      * Correction: "William, et. al., " --> "William, et al."  (note 
            * that et is not an abbreviation) 
      * Jason: goes over year 3 
      * Tom: MAA mini workshops on Sage much sooner than we have on our 
            * timeline.  minicourses much easier to get through than PREP. Topics: How to use sage in classroom.  Demonstrations.  More than just showing people things, but how to make their own. Look at an existing minisession in San Fran and just build off of one of those.  And/or mathfest. 
      * Jason: overview 
                  1. get our own books in and do huge amount of background to make sage more usable in classroom; getting reports about how 
                  1. more textbooks; pull in outside people to start writing materials.  make it easy for people to setup sage servers themselves;  
                  1. changing things that needed to be changed; lots of workshops, teach people to write their own materials.  setting up for future grants.  
      * William: compare to list of moodle (?) sites.   
      * Tom: 1 question and 1 comment.  I emailed Sandra...   Question: next call? 
      * Next Thursday at 11am. 
      * DAVID:  
                  * need to redo the budget 
                  * need to reword proposal so it is exciting to non-sage people.   
                  * everything about sage and its technical stuff comes at the END! 
                  * anecdotes.  what is the _education research_ you are doing? 
      * William:  
                  * try to make a budget for activities 
                  * a page where people can put the dollar amount they need 
                  * pay programmers 
                  * own salary 
                  * travel 
                  * get some things *right* instead of having it all messed up later
