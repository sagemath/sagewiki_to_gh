   budget: * summer salary (but not next year)

  pedagogy.   High needs school districts in East Texas.

 * Jason adds lots of user friendly documentation.  Subject specific
 tutorials.  "Here are the commands you need to know in order to do
 multivariate calculus."

 * Food for thought from Tom Judson: K-12?  A lot of people at *college* are also teaching some advanced high school classes.  E.g., high school AP would benefit from what we would do.  Dual credit.

 * Resources for someone -- takes a long time to create an example on your own.


 * 3 years.

 * Jason Grout: one other idea that may be nixed.  Standalone notebook aspect. Or at least something with browser.

   * william: 4 months summer salary
   * beezer:  6 months summer salary (possibly half academic year)
   * grout:   6 months summer salary

Writing the actual proposal

 * Grass roots: Get support letters from uni's that they would use our materials.
     * "Wish something was free"
     * different versions, antiquated versions of mathematica;

 * Wiki to write grant together. *

 * Length: 15 page project description + supplement letter

 * Outline of proposal.

TODO LIST:

1. William -- make rough outline of proposal so we can write it on the
wiki... [gosh, we need a latex version of google docs :-) ]

2. Rob  -- very rough internal proposal by next week

3. Somebody -- list of places that "want sage" and are willing to
write in support of it.
