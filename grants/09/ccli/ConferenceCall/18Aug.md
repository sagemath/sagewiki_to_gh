= 18 Aug Conference Call =

This is fleshed out from William's email notes.

  * Dissemination is an important point in the proposal to think seriously about.
    * what conferences people are going to present these results at

    * exactly how you are going to tell people about your products

  * Some deliverables

    * translate various appendices of books that contain code for the 4Ms to Sage; talk with author about including these in the textbook

    * online textbook with interactive computations

    * A system for easily producing such interactive textbooks

    * webwork integration

    * don't make windows port a delivarable

  * don't ask for something unless you want it.

  * ask for as much as we can to say


  * Ken Bogart, Dartmouth College -- NSF funded guided discovery in combinatorics (see below)

  * we're the guinea pigs; now it's time to get lots of other people up
  and running

  * high minority --

  * get community college classes using sage

  * ed. research about math software helps students

    * http://cm.math.uiuc.edu/studies -- Calculus and Mathematica is a book/course using Mathematica to teach calculus.  This is a page talking about studies related to this course.

    * http://media.wolfram.com/documents/fowler/  -- Wolfram has put some time into compiling research that supports using technology and math software in teaching.

    * http://www.maa.org/columns/launchings/launchings_04_09.html  -- References some studies about the effectiveness of webwork.

  * David Farmer -- just

  * Tom Judson -- possible math ed assistance

  * http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/webwork.html

  * find out about background

  * circulate a list of delivarables + what it would take to do them

  * what we would like to do behind the scenes.
