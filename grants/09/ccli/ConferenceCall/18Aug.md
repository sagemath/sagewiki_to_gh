# 18 Aug Conference Call

This is fleshed out from William's email notes. 

   * Dissemination is an important point in the proposal to think seriously about. 
         * what conferences people are going to present these results at 
         * exactly how you are going to tell people about your products 
   * Some deliverables 
         * translate various appendices of books that contain code for the 4Ms to Sage; talk with author about including these in the textbook 
         * online textbook with interactive computations 
         * A system for easily producing such interactive textbooks 
         * webwork integration 
         * don't make windows port a delivarable 
   * don't ask for something unless you want it. 
   * ask for as much as we can to say 
   * Ken Bogart, Dartmouth College -- NSF funded guided discovery in combinatorics (see below) 
   * we're the guinea pigs; now it's time to get lots of other people up and running 
   * high minority -- 
   * get community college classes using sage 
   * ed. research about math software helps students 
         * <a href="http://cm.math.uiuc.edu/studies">http://cm.math.uiuc.edu/studies</a> -- Calculus and Mathematica is a book/course using Mathematica to teach calculus.  This is a page talking about studies related to this course. 
         * <a href="http://media.wolfram.com/documents/fowler/">http://media.wolfram.com/documents/fowler/</a>  -- Wolfram has put some time into compiling research that supports using technology and math software in teaching. 
         * <a href="http://www.maa.org/columns/launchings/launchings_04_09.html">http://www.maa.org/columns/launchings/launchings_04_09.html</a>  -- References some studies about the effectiveness of webwork. 
   * David Farmer -- just 
   * Tom Judson -- possible math ed assistance 
   * <a href="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/webwork.html">http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/webwork.html</a> 
   * find out about background 
   * circulate a list of delivarables + what it would take to do them 
   * what we would like to do behind the scenes.
