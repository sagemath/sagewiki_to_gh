* Jason's Notes (with Rob's commentary) 

   * This was a conference call between Rob, Jason, and Dan Maki of the NSF (a program officer for CCLI grants).  Here are a list of points he mentioned (though I may not be quoting directly, I tried to get down the ideas of what he was saying). 
   * We hear of lots of proposals that do similar things (Rob: maybe not CAS in a book, though), but none that has involved Sage 
   * Burden of proof—often involves a successful phase 1.  Does it work in a calculus setting?  Document that calculus in things using computer algebra systems actually work.  Make the case the CAS works, this approach works, etc.  There may be some doubt among some of the reviewers.  It doesn't have to be a huge amount, but citing a list of studies would be helpful. 
   * Technology questions—people will be able to run it on netbooks, cell phones, etc.  More people are talking about electronic books.  Talk about the diverse ways people can access these things. 
   * There will be people who say---these are modestly big grants.  We want a really good evaluation. 
   * Trying with diverse kinds of students.  Community college with high minority population.  Elite liberal arts school, high school.  I can't emphasize this enough.  It would probably not be a problem to "pay the expenses" of someone outside the U.S. to classroom test Sage and write a report. 
   * In the grant, give lists of specific names of people and schools that will be classroom-testing Sage. 
   * Be sure to have a 1.0 draft of the grant early enough that people down the hall from you can read it; someone you haven't talked to, etc.  Make sure that they understand what you thought you wrote.   
   * There has been a big push into webworks.  Talk about how you are looking to the future for integrating in these sorts of things, if that's a future goal. (Jason mentioned our planned workshop with webworks guys at the end of the grant---we should probably talk to someone in webworks about that.)  (Rob:  Maki is very familiar with <a href="/WebWorks">WebWorks</a>.  We explained our decision to not be overly broad, and he understood entirely - I think it was in our favor to have been rational about that.) 
   * Mention the MAA and what you're doing with the PREP proposal 
   * AMS just did a study on a number of schools using electronic homework systems; the data should be coming out soon---it was surprising how many places have switched to online homework. 
   * You are welcome to ask me (Dan) questions via email or phone.  I can't edit your grant, though. (Jason thinks he said he could give us feedback on a draft, though).  (Rob was looking for feedback on a draft, and didn't hear that.) 
   * We definitely want to encourage these types of proposals.  I'm interested in it, though I can't guarantee that all the reviewers will share my interest.  I'll probably look at Sage online now that we've talked, but then I'll probably get too busy to follow up on it. 
* Rob's To Do List based on the call 

         * Demonstrate some sort of Type 1 activities ("track record", "documented", "evaluative") 
                     * Beezer's abstract algebra materials 
                     * Stein's number theory text (class-use we can document?) 
                     * Crisman's number-theory text in-progress 
         * Solicit classroom testers in advance 
                     * At one extreme, we could poll sage-edu, etc for "expressions of interest" 
                     * Want a "diverse range of student populations" 
         * We need a lower-division text, ie calculus 
                     * Maki didn't say this, but we need something for community colleges, high schools - abstract algebra, number theory, combinatorics, even linear algebra probably won't work for a community college test site 
                     * Whitman Calculus would be a candidate - others? 
         * Get a draft together we can give to mathematicians who know *nothing* about what we are proposing.  Purpose is to get feedback on if the ideas hold together and "make sense" on first exposure (like a panelist will see it) 
         * Initiate informal contact with <a href="/WebWorks">WebWorks</a> group (and/or Michael Pearson at MAA) 
                     * Need to discuss this as a future direction in grant, so don't want to be 100% speculative, but we don't have to propose actually doing anything 
                     * Find (upcoming?) AMS survey on popularity of online homework system use 
         * NSF feels pressure about evaluations, they need to demonstrate results.  So get some evaluation going very early and sustain it.
