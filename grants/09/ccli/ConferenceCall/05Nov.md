= Conference Call On November 5, 2009 =

  * Rob Beezer -- 3-minute elevator speech -- giving an overview of
    his anecdotes and history:

        * "This did not have the transformative effect that people
          wanted it to."

        * A hundred sliders out there... but this is *integrated* with
          a textbook.

        * No computer lab needed.  Any browser. 

        * There are a variety of reason that mathematica didn't catch
          on.  We feel we know how to address all of these.

        * "encourages unimagined new approaches to textbooks":
             * korea; mobile phone page
 
        * many people can do what we're doing; tone down the "gee whiz".

        * getting everybody involved. 

        * David: "creating things tailored to specific applications
          that are going to happen".

   * David -- everybody -- "why -- what are you doing?  what more?"

       * William -- selling point; "designed and started by students!"
         aims at students, comfortable for students.  Today's
         students.  Our project strongly reflects student input.
         Everybody believes that student's know more about computers.

       * Tom -- texbooks onlines; getting rid of printed copies.  We
         are meeting these needs.  We are the *only* group that can do
         this.  Nobody else can do this without a lot of money,
         agreements.


== Tom: Report on conv with Sandra Laurson and Mary Leese ==

   They are at U Colorado.  Doing an evaluation right now on a 3-4
   college CCLI grant.   Michigan, Chicago, Texas. 

    Help with: Pedegagy student outcome, curriculum

    Nope: evaluating technology (ui design, etc.)

She pointed out that they don't care about "being free", but do care
about what we do with the opportunities that open source textbooks
provide.

    Question about impact of CAS has already been asked and answered.

Brian Conrey: Do not give away to NSF that we don't know what we're
doing as far as evaluation goes...

Tom had a very positive experience working with her. 

David Farmer: need to polish our grant a bit more before showing it to
her.

Revisit next Wednesday.


== Get proposal in shape ==

  * David Farmer request: Jason Grout -- add a bunch of section titles
    all over the place.  try to make it in the right order.
    Structure *must* tell a story.  But need people to keep reading. 

  * 

== Budget ==

   * Hannah trumps everybody

   * Subcontract -- wait 2 weeks to find out what happens...

   * William explains how flexible AIM hiring consultants is.

   * subcrontracting is university-by-university

   * travel/reimbursement/students/programming contracts -- through AIM

   * your own salary -- maybe through UW, maybe through AIM

== TIMELINE ==

   * Timeline should be in narrative form in the actual proposal. 
 
   * Picture the timeline in your head by the end, or disaster.  No diagram.
