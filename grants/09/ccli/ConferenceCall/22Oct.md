 * William describes the wiki.

 * Make sure to explain super clearly why this is a CCLI *type 2*.

 * Dan Maki -- Jason will contact him.   Program officer with MSP. 

 * Get it into schools. Evaluate effectiveness. 
   
 * How do places use the materials we develop?

 * Find universities not using anything and provide them with necessary support: this is not only for Sage experts.

 * Dept. in Texas very good at getting a large number of math ed in-service teachers grants; large math sciences partnership grant.  Got a supplement.    How?  Jump on plane, go to NSF, face-to-face, what do you want?  How could we make this successful?   Kim Childs batting average is 1000.   We should make a call to NSF and ask advice.   

 * David Farmer: 'William is clearly not the person to do this, since he is an outside person, would appear to be just asking for something from this "big pot of money".  Rob Beezer is the one for this.  Volunteer AIM people to pretend they are program officers.'

 * Jason Grout: Sage-ify Putnam problem book.   There are many Putnam "courses" all over the country.   Worry: This could either add 2 percent or subtract 50 percent, depending on who is reading the proposal. 

 * Tom Judson: There are a lot of sections; how can we actually do it?    What should we chose?  "We can assign people to each project, then integrate the results." 

 * Need a timeline, clear list of what, when, and who.   Each group could independently make their timeline, then we can see how it fits together.  This helps addresses the issue of focus. 

 * Division of work for now:
    * The Sage Notebook: william (code), jason (code);  rob (test), kiran (test)
    * Subject specific tutorials: rob (writing), jason (reviewer)
    * Webwork and Moodle Integration: jason -- we shouldn't do this yet.  huge area.
