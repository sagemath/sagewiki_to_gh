Here are very rough notes from Jason for parts of the conference call:

For dan's conference call, have names of people, like our evaluator

tom - North Carolina State has a program for preparing to teach mathematics with an integrated technology approach.  A question they are having from NSF is making it technology-independent.  How do we answer "how come this grant can't be more technology-independent"

rob - Sage is latex-friendly

William - you can't post the notebook online because of license restrictions.  Sage has interfaces to all these other systems---it *is* technology independent

David - Sage *is* technology independent.  Diversity!  Everyone can access this.  We need to put this technology-independent issue in the proposal and emphasize the diverse people that can use this.

David - Explain research on adoption of technology methods.

Tom - working with Sandra Larson at U of Colorado who does research on pedagogy.  Has experience on multiple CCLI grants.  We are developing a plan in consultation with her to study the impact on faculty and student learning.  We are doing formative yearly evaluation, and the evaluation will drive the development and the math education research questions.  We feel the impact on the curriculum could be significant 

William - we aren't doing the same thing as 10 years ago.  This is the next step to do even more.

Tom - integrating Sage into materials gives us the opportunity.  

David - tell him the kind research we are planning; see what he thinks about the driving question behind the proposal.


David-next week is budget

Jason - in charge of moving the grant back to William's system on the sage wiki.
