\subsection{Integrating Sage and WebWork}

The first task would be to make it possible to use Sage to help answer WebWork problems.

The next project would be to make it possible to use Sage interacts in WebWork, for example, to experiment with 
an idea while answering a WebWork problem.

A third project would be to make it possible to use Sage to help write WebWork questions 
(e.g., ``Find the integral of \verb|\sage{diff(x^2,x)}|.'', where Sage takes the answer and makes a question).
