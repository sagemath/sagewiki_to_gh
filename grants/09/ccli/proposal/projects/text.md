\subsection{Creating worksheet collections from Latex or Sphinx source files}

Describe plane to finish Rob Beezer's system for easily creating worksheets from textbook source files.
Also, plan for bundling a collection of worksheets into a more high-level document (basically a packaged
version of the Sphinx documentation). 

\subsection{Specific Textbooks}

    Beezer's linear algebra textbook: \url{http://linear.pugetsound.edu/}

    Judson's algebra textbook: \url{http://abstract.ups.edu/}

    Bogart's problem book in combinatorics: \url{http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/}

    Stein's {\em Elementary Number Theory: Primes, Congruences, and Secrets}: \url{http://wstein.org/ent/}

    Michael Corral's {\em Vector Calculus}: \url{http://www.mecmath.net/}

    Michael Corral's {\em Trigonmetry}: \url{http://mecmath.net/trig/}

    

\subsection{Translation to Sage of Mathematica, Matlab, and Maple code for existing books}


\subsection{Building a Textbook Community}

We propose getting a community of people writing textbooks or course notes using 
Sage and converting them to folders of worksheets.

    * Sponsor a workshop on this (via AIM?)

    * Sponsor Joint Meetings workshop/Mathfest workshop on this

    * Mini-grants for people to convert textbooks and course notes to Sage

    * Mini-grants for people to write course materials for Sage (e.g., interacts) 

\subsection{Summer Workshops}

Summer workshops for each year after the first for faculty to write curriculum materials using Sage, i.e., Sage EduDays :)

    * Regional workshops--there are a lot of smaller schools in Iowa, for example. It might be viable to invite people from smaller schools in the area. Also, there are lots of faculty in universities in the Southeast U.S. from schools with large minority populations that were exposed to Sage at AIM; maybe a regional conference there would be a big hit.

    *      National workshops (via AIM, if appropriate?)--invite people from all over
