\subsection{Creating worksheet collections from Latex or Sphinx source files}

Describe plane to finish Rob Beezer's system for easily creating worksheets from textbook source files.
Also, plan for bundling a collection of worksheets into a more high-level document (basically a packaged
version of the Sphinx documentation). 

\subsection{Specific Textbooks}

    Beezer's linear algebra textbook

    Judson's algebra textbook

    Bogart's problem book in combinatorics 

\subsection{Translation to Sage of Mathematica, Matlab, and Maple code for existing books}


\subsection{Building a Textbook Community}

We propose getting a community of people writing textbooks or course notes using 
Sage and converting them to folders of worksheets.

    * Sponsor a workshop on this (via AIM?)

    * Sponsor Joint Meetings workshop/Mathfest workshop on this

    * Mini-grants for people to convert textbooks and course notes to Sage

    * Mini-grants for people to write course materials for Sage (e.g., interacts)
