\section{Sage-Enhanced Interactive Textbooks}


\subsection{Creating worksheet collections from Latex or Sphinx source files}

Describe plane to finish Rob Beezer's system for easily creating worksheets from textbook source files.
Also, plan for bundling a collection of worksheets into a more high-level document (basically a packaged
version of the Sphinx documentation). 

\subsection{Candidate Open-Source Textbooks for Conversion or Supplements}

Each of the textbooks below is licensed with a GNU Free Documentation Licenses (GFDL) or a Creative Commons License that allows anyone to distribute modified versions, typically only requiring attribution of the original author's work and the use of the same license.

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\sl A First Course in Linear Algebra}, Robert Beezer, \url{http://linear.pugetsound.edu/}.\\
Second-year university level text, concentrating on understanding how to understand and formulate proofs.  Used at thirteen schools since Fall~2007.  Contains some Sage commands.

\item {\sl Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications}, Tom Judson, \url{http://abstract.ups.edu/}.\\
Standard upper-division treatment of groups, rings, domains, fields, Galois Theory.  Published commercially in 1992, released as open source in 2007.  Used by seven schools in its first year available.  Supplement describes group theory in Sage.

\item {\sl Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery}, Kenneth Bogart, \url{http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/}.\\
Problem book in combinatorics with roughly 400 problems designed to teach the subject.  NSF funded, released as open source.

\item {\sl Elementary Number Theory: Primes, Congruences, and Secrets}, William Stein, \url{http://wstein.org/ent/}.\\
Published by Springer-Verlag, will be available with open license in [[Month~Year????]].  [[Add capsule summary]]  [[Add extent of Sage usage (massive?)]]  [[Open license consistent with paragraph above?]]

\item {\sl Vector Calculus}, Michael Corral, \url{http://www.mecmath.net/}.\\
Standard treatment of multivariate calculus: vector calculus, partial derivatives, multiple integrals, theorems of Green and Stokes.  Impressive graphics.

\item {\sl Trigonometry}, Michael Corral, \url{http://mecmath.net/trig/}.\\
An in-depth, comprehensive and unified treatment of the typical high-school topics.  Impressive graphics.

\item {\sl Cryptography}, David Kohel, \url{http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/~kohel/tch/Crypto/crypto.pdf}.\\
Classical ciphers and their cryptanalysis, modern stream ciphers and public-key cryptography.  Significant appendices on Sage.

\end{enumerate}    

\subsection{Translation to Sage of Mathematica, Matlab, and Maple code for existing books}


\subsection{Building a Textbook Community}

We propose getting a community of people writing textbooks or course notes using 
Sage and converting them to folders of worksheets.

    * Sponsor a workshop on this (via AIM?)

    * Sponsor Joint Meetings workshop/Mathfest workshop on this

    * Mini-grants for people to convert textbooks and course notes to Sage

    * Mini-grants for people to write course materials for Sage (e.g., interacts) 

\subsection{Summer Workshops}

Summer workshops for each year after the first for faculty to write curriculum materials using Sage, i.e., Sage EduDays :)

    * Regional workshops--there are a lot of smaller schools in Iowa, for example. It might be viable to invite people from smaller schools in the area. Also, there are lots of faculty in universities in the Southeast U.S. from schools with large minority populations that were exposed to Sage at AIM; maybe a regional conference there would be a big hit.

    *      National workshops (via AIM, if appropriate?)--invite people from all over
