\section{Making Sage Classroom Ready}

In this section we describe Sage development projects that will
make the Sage library of functionality fully ready for classroom use
for undergraduate courses in linear algebra, abstract algebra,
calculus, differential equations, number theory, and combinatorics. 

\begin{verbatim}
# Go through linear algebra; make interfaces consistent and implement anything else an undergrad course in linear algebra would need
# Finish Robert Miller's fast C graph backends
# Polish graphics

    * Make 2d graphics have transformations (i.e., rotate, translate, etc.)
    * Expose matplotlib better, so we don't have to just duplicate everything that matplotlib has. 

# Polish any issues in calculus (e.g., see recent sage-devel posts about differentation) 
\end{verbatim}
