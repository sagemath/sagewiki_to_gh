\section{Making Sage Classroom Ready}

In this section we describe Sage development projects that will
make the Sage library of functionality fully ready for classroom use
for undergraduate courses in linear algebra, abstract algebra,
calculus, differential equations, number theory, and combinatorics. 

Also, we emphasize that undergraduates will contribute directly to 
these projects, and this has a double impact, since we are bringing 
as many students in as possible to do development {\em while} we 
are carrying out our project, instead of waiting until the end.

\subsection{Linear Algebra}
Go through linear algebra; make interfaces consistent and implement anything else an undergrad course in linear algebra would need

\subsection{Abstract Algebra}

\subsection{Graph Theory and Combinatorics}

Robert Miller's fast C graph backends.

\subsection{2d and 3d Plotting}

Make 2d graphics have transformations (i.e., rotate, translate, etc.)

Expose matplotlib better, so we don't have to just duplicate everything that matplotlib has. 

\subsection{Calculus}
Polish any issues in calculus (e.g., see recent sage-devel posts about differentation)

\subsection{Number Theory}


\subsection{Differential Equations}
