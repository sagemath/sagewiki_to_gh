\section{Subject Specific Tutorials}

We propose to create subject specific tutorials to answer questions such as:

\begin{quote}
``What are the Sage commands you need to know in order to do multivariate calculus?''
\end{quote}

We propose to create a systematic and organized collection of subject specific tutorials and interacts to include with Sage.  

[[Mention the "sage primers" education-oriented project at the Georgia Sage Days]]

\subsection{Included Browsable Catalog of Interacts}

\subsection{Mini-grants for people to write subject-specific tutorials}

[[Mini-grants for faculty to write curriculum materials (textbooks/course notes/tutorials/interacts) using Sage. Maybe a few thousand dollars each? A summer salary, or a one-course buyout for a semester?]]
