\subsection{Vignette - Taylor Series}

(But we aren't converting a calculus textbook! Should we use an example
from a textbook we are actually converting?


\subsection{Vignette - High school teacher accessing an interact from within
Sage for their classroom}

Some sort of vignette talking about high school is important because
CCLI emphasizes preparing K-12 teachers. If we show we are empowering
K-12 teachers, that is a great thing we should point out. Make sure
to say because we are free, high schools have an extra incentive to
use it.


\subsection{Vignette - Students collaborating, working from home and school
together, maybe in an advanced undergraduate course}

Maybe on an algebra project that requires stuff in Sage that only
Sage and Magma have.


\subsection{Vignette - Teacher converting notes or modifying the textbook (maybe
at a small liberal arts school)}
