\section{Introduction}



\subsection{Textbooks and curricula in the computer age}



\subsubsection{Previous approaches}

Mathematica and calculus, Banchoff (Brown), etc.  Successful approaches exist, but they have not been widely adopted

Cited previous research should back up the advantages and disadvantages below.

We need to back up the idea that using CAS in teaching is effective (some reviewers may doubt it).

\subsubsection{Advantages}

higher test scores, etc.

\begin{itemize}
\item  inquiry-based learning
\item  can do examples too large to do by hand, concentrating on the concepts rather than arithmetic
\item  Demonstrated higher grades for lots of different kinds of students
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Disadvantages}

costs, driven by technology, radical departure from traditional teaching\ldots{}


\begin{itemize}
\item  Deficiencies in software (like no algebra, vector fields, etc.) 
\item  Driven by technology more than by curriculum
\item  Costs (lots of) money (so diverse institutions/high schools may have trouble affording it). Not just software, but also the style of having every class in the computer labnot every college campus can transition every class to a computer lab.  At many institutions, purchasing computer softwareespecially mathematical softwareis a significant burden, and Sage has helped address this problem.
\item  Radical departure in course styletoo radical for widespread adoption?
\end{itemize}
