\subsection{Textbooks and curricula in the computer age}



\subsubsection{Previous approaches}

Mathematica and calculus, Banchoff (Brown), etc.  Successful approaches exist, but they have not been widely adopted


\subsubsection{Advantages}

higher test scores, etc.


\subsubsection{Disadvantages}

costs, driven by technology, radical departure from traditional teaching\ldots{}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Defficiencies in software (like no algebra, vector fields, etc.) 
\item Driven by technology more than by curriculum 
\item Costs (lots of) money (so diverse institutions/high schools may have
trouble affording it). Not just software, but also the style of having
every class in the computer lab---not every college campus can transition
every class to a computer lab. 
\item Radical departure in course style---too radical for widespread adoption?
\end{itemize}
