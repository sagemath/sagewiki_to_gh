\section{Evaluation}

The evaluation plan will measure the impact of Sage on undergraduate students, faculty, and the curriculum.  More specifically, the plan will include methodologies for measuring 
\begin{enumerate}

\item
the effectiveness of the project in developing Sage integrated curriculum materials such as Sage integrated with open source textbooks,

\item
the effectiveness of the use of Sage integrated  materials within the secondary and undergraduate classroom.

\end{enumerate}
The evaluation plan will also include a mechanism for tracking the implementation of Sage materials into the undergraduate and high school classroom by working with selected test sites.  We will create an online tracking system to ensure that timely and accurate qualitative and quantitative data are collected for all test sites, including demographic data and statistics as well as service obligations.

Experience with previous, similar projects guides the evaluation plan for this effort. [Note:  Add in the qualifications and experience of the evaluators.]  




\subsection{Formative Evaluation}

The formative component of the evaluation will focus on monitoring the quality of project activities, enabling the project to make mid-course corrections where needed and will address (1) the effectiveness of the project in developing Sage integrated materials. The summative component will focus on the impact of the project on the students and teachers at the test sites and will address (2) the effectiveness of the Sage-integrated materials in the undergraduate and high school classroom.  We plan to gather information on the contributions of the project to the fieldâ€™s knowledge about future development of CAS integrated curricular materials.

The formative evaluation will be guided by the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item
To what extent are Sage integrated materials and the support for these materials designed to the needs of the test sites.

\item
To what extent are the Sage integrated materials  transportable/scalable to other undergraduate and high school classrooms?

\end{enumerate}
