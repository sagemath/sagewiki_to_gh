\section{Evaluation}

The evaluation plan will measure the impact of Sage on undergraduate students, faculty, and the curriculum.  More specifically, the plan will include methodologies for measuring 
\begin{enumerate}

\item
the effectiveness of the project in developing Sage integrated curriculum materials such as Sage integrated with open source textbooks,

\item
the effectiveness of the use of Sage integrated  materials within the secondary and undergraduate classroom.

\end{enumerate}
The evaluation plan will also include a mechanism for tracking the implementation of Sage materials into the undergraduate and high school classroom by working with selected test sites.  We will create an online tracking system to ensure that timely and accurate qualitative and quantitative data are collected for all test sites, including demographic data and statistics as well as service obligations.

Experience with previous, similar projects guides the evaluation plan for this effort. [Note:  Add in the qualifications and experience of the evaluators.]
