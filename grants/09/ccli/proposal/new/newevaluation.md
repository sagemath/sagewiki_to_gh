\section{Evaluation}

Thomas Judson, Mathematics/Mathematics Education Researcher, and a consulting evaluator (statistician), will develop appropriate evaluative measures to study the impact of Sage on undergraduate students, faculty, and the curriculum.  Project personnel will employ the formative and summative results of this extended funding period to develop a complete picture of the impact that the Sage has on student achievement and teacher quality.

Judson along with other project personnel will conduct evaluation activities including questionnaires, site visits and interviews of undergraduate faculty and students. Quantitative as well as qualitative evidence and data (in the form of faculty and student opinions and reflections) can likewise be collected and reported in an effort to further analyze Sage and Sage-based materials effect on teachers, and students, and curriculum. Of particular interest is the impact of Sage and free open-source textbooks on the undergraduate community.  Effective tools will be developed to measure the spread of Sage and free open-source textbooks as well as the actual success of these materials.
