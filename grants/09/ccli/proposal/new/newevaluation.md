\section{Evaluation}

The evaluation plan will measure the impact of Sage on undergraduate students, faculty, and the curriculum.  More specifically, the plan will include methodologies for measuring 
\begin{enumerate}

\item
the effectiveness of the project in developing Sage integrated curriculum materials such as Sage integrated with open source textbooks,

\item
the effectiveness of the use of Sage integrated  materials within the secondary and undergraduate classroom.

\end{enumerate}
The evaluation plan will also include a mechanism for tracking the implementation of Sage materials into the undergraduate and high school classroom by working with selected test sites.  We will create an online tracking system to ensure that timely and accurate qualitative and quantitative data are collected for all test sites, including demographic data and statistics as well as service obligations.

Experience with previous, similar projects guides the evaluation plan for this effort. [Note:  Add in the qualifications and experience of the evaluators.]  




\subsection{Formative Evaluation}

The formative component of the evaluation will focus on monitoring the quality of project activities, enabling the project to make mid-course corrections where needed and will address (1) the effectiveness of the project in developing Sage integrated materials. The summative component will focus on the impact of the project on the students and teachers at the test sites and will address (2) the effectiveness of the Sage-integrated materials in the undergraduate and high school classroom.  We plan to gather information on the contributions of the project to the field’s knowledge about future development of CAS integrated curricular materials.

The formative evaluation will be guided by the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item
To what extent are Sage integrated materials and the support for these materials designed to the needs of the test sites.

\item
To what extent are the Sage integrated materials  transportable/scalable to other undergraduate and high school classrooms?

\end{enumerate}

The formative aspects of the evaluation will collect information on key aspects of the project to assess and provide feedback on the extent to which the project is designed and implemented to address important needs effectively. The key aspects of the project on which the evaluation will focus are: the  need for, and resources to support,  Sage enhanced materials in the classroom; and creation of materials that can be used more broadly in high school and university mathematics classrooms.  Classroom needs and resource commitments will be documented through teacher surveys and interviews.  The basis for selection of participating teachers and classrooms will be based on interest in the project and support from the teacher's institution.


\subsection{Summative Evaluation}

The summative evaluation will be guided by the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}

\item
What is the impact of CAS integrated materials on teachers content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge and classroom instructional practice?

\item
What is the impact of CAS integrated materials on in their own classrooms, campuses/districts on their students’ mathematics learning and participation in advanced-level mathematics courses?

\item
What is the ease of implementing CAS integrated materials on a wide scale basis?


\end{enumerate}

To measure these changes Dr.\ Judson will collaborate with the project director and other members of the project  and will consult with Marja-Liisa Hassi and Sandra Laursen of Ethnography \& Evaluation Research (E\&ER) at the  Center to Advance Research and Teaching in the Social Sciences (CARTSS) at the University of Colorado in the selection of appropriate instruments to  identify measures of for specific areas of the project.  Drs.\ Hassi and Laursen have extensive experience evaluating other large mathematics and science education projects (NSF Awards \# 0920126, \# 0723600 \# 0450088). [Note:  I am not sure that these are the appropriate projects that we should mention, but I am assuming that Marja-Liisa will rewrite this part of the proposal.] To insure alignment to project goals, measures for the classroom will not be selected until the Sage-enhanced materials have been developed. The measures will be administered to participants at appropriate intervals throughout the project period.

Drs.\  Hassi and Judson and the project PIs will conduct site visits to partner institutions to observe and document the use of Sage-enhanced materials as the project progresses. Additional data will be collected through periodic surveys of all participants, and interviews of a sample. All surveys and interviews will be prepared and conducted by Drs.\  Hassi and Judson. 

Drs.\  Hassi and Judson will collaborate with the appropriate institutions to collect demographic data on schools, teachers, and students within participating schools. They will analyze all data using appropriate statistical measures and will prepare one annual report per year documenting all evaluation activities and results and will provide formative evaluation feedback to the project PIs in presentations and correspondence timed to inform design decisions and mid-course corrections.
