\section{Introduction}


The goal of the Sage project is to create viable easy-to-use free open source mathematical software to support both research and  education and in mathematics, engineering and the sciences.    Success would have a
genuinely transformational impact on the mathematical sciences, broadly impacting people 
involved with mathematics at all levels.  It would have the potential to have a profound impact
on how mathematics is taught and done for decades to come. 

We propose five specific groups of projects in order to make major progress toward this goal:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Sage Notebook -- improve the world's most sophisticated mathematical web application
\item Subject Specific Tutorials -- create class-room ready targeted Sage tutorials for linear 
algebra, calculus, differential equations, graph theory, etc., 
\item WebWork and Moodle Integration -- 
\item Sage Enhanced Interactive Textbooks --
\item Making Sage Classroom Ready -- 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is Sage?}
Sage is a cohesive distribution of nearly 100 pieces of open source
mathematics software.  Creating this distribution has required the combined
work of over 200 developers, and demands regular
maintenance (which would be partly funded by this proposal)
to remain up to date.  Various open source
programs can easily be obtained as part of Sage:

``I would like to thank everyone who responded to my question 
about installing PARI on an iMAC.
The consensus was that it would be simplest to install Sage, 
which includes PARI and many other things.
I tried this and it worked! 

Thanks!

The bottomline is that there are many excellent free and open-source 
mathematics software packages out there.  However, these donâ€™t interact well.
Some suffer from ``not invented here'' syndrome and reinvent the wheel 
over and over again. Many, many specialized packages are leaders in their 
field but are not embedded in some greater framework.  This is the problem that the
Sage project attempts  to solve: 
\begin{quote}
{\bf Create a unified free, open-source mathematics 
package and  liberate the mathematical sciences}.
\end{quote}


\subsection{Prior Support}

The PI's have used his startup money at UC San Diego and University of Washington, 
his NSF grants (DMS-0555776, [[add more]]), and the UW's NSF VIGRE grant to
support xxx Sage workshops, xxx undergraduate employees, four graduate 
students, and research visitors. Add more...

{\bf Other Grant Applications:} xxx has also applied this year to
the NSF COMPMATH program to fund ...
