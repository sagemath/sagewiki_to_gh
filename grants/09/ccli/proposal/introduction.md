\section{Introduction}

Stein embarked
on a new and risky research path at Harvard in 2005, when he started
the Sage mathematical software project, which has greatly grown since
then.  There are now over 200 Sage developers, and last month there were
well over 5,000 downloads of Sage, and over 75,000 visits (sessions of consecutive page views) to the \url{http://sagemath.org} website.  
The free \url{http://sagenb.org} online Sage website has about
15,000 user accounts. 

Sage can be used to study general and advanced, pure and applied
mathematics. This includes a huge range of mathematics, including
algebra, calculus, elementary to very advanced number theory,
cryptography, numerical computation, commutative algebra, group
theory, combinatorics, graph theory, exact linear algebra and much
more.  Sage combines various software packages and seamlessly
integrates their functionality into a common experience. It is well
suited for education, studying and research.  The interface to Sage is
a notebook in a web-browser or the command-line. 
Inside the Sage notebook, you can create
embedded graphics, beautifully typeset mathematical expressions, add
and delete input, and share your work across the network.


Instead of students and researchers having to pay to buy expensive
commercial mathematical software, they now have the option to use Sage
for free.  At many institutions, purchasing computer
software---especially mathematical software---is a significant burden,
and Sage has helped address this problem.  Moreover, because Sage is
free, it is available to many more undergraduates, high school
students, and non-mathematicians.

A central technical advantage of Sage over existing mathematical
software is that Sage uses the mainstream Python programming language.
Because Sage is built on Python, modern exception handling and name
spaces are inherent. Sage can be easily extended with new user-defined
data types, and since Python is such a widely used programming
language, there already exists a huge variety of extension modules.
In addition, Sage uses the Cython compiler for writing extremely fast
code. In contrast, any other major mathematics software invented its
own language, often a slow interpreted language, so that any extension
requires a new implementation.  And one must not forget that computer
based research also involves non-mathematical programming, e.g.,
create a web server to distribute the results of computations, or
connect to an online database or web page and parse the results. By
using Python, all this is easily done in Sage.

Thus the goal of the Sage project is to create viable easy-to-use free open source mathematical software to support both research and  education and in mathematics, engineering and the sciences.    Success would have a
genuinely transformational impact on the mathematical sciences, broadly 
impacting people 
involved with mathematics at all levels.  It would have the potential 
to have a profound impact
on how mathematics is taught and done for decades to come. 

We propose five specific groups of projects in order to make 
major progress toward this goal:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Sage Notebook -- improve the world's most sophisticated mathematical web application
\item Subject Specific Tutorials -- create class-room ready targeted Sage tutorials for linear 
algebra, calculus, differential equations, graph theory, etc., 
\item WebWork and Moodle Integration -- sophisticated Sage-assisted automated homework assignments and course management
\item Sage Enhanced Interactive Textbooks -- for abstract algebra, linear algebra, combinatorics, and calculus
\item Making Sage Classroom Ready -- fill in every gap in functionality that instructors
need
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is Sage?}
Sage is a cohesive distribution of nearly 100 pieces of open source
mathematics software.  Creating this distribution has required the combined
work of over 200 developers, and demands regular
maintenance (which would be partly funded by this proposal)
to remain up to date.  Various open source
programs can easily be obtained as part of Sage:

``I would like to thank everyone who responded to my question 
about installing PARI on an iMAC.
The consensus was that it would be simplest to install Sage, 
which includes PARI and many other things.
I tried this and it worked! 

Thanks!

(It is such a shock when things actually work!!)''
\end{quote}

The bottomline is that there are many excellent free and open-source 
mathematics software packages out there.  However, these donâ€™t interact well.
Some suffer from ``not invented here'' syndrome and reinvent the wheel 
over and over again. Many, many specialized packages are leaders in their 
field but are not embedded in some greater framework.  This is the problem that the
Sage project attempts  to solve: 
\begin{quote}
{\bf Create a unified free, open-source mathematics 
package and  liberate the mathematical sciences}.
\end{quote}


\subsection{Prior Support}

The PI's have used his startup money at UC San Diego and University of Washington, 
his NSF grants (DMS-0555776, [[add more]]), and the UW's NSF VIGRE grant to
support xxx Sage workshops, xxx undergraduate employees, four graduate 
students, and research visitors. Add more...

{\bf Other Grant Applications:} xxx has also applied this year to
the NSF COMPMATH program to fund ...
