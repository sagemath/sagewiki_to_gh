\section{Introduction}


The goal of the Sage project is to create viable easy-to-use free open source mathematical software to support both research and  education and in mathematics, engineering and the sciences. 


Sage is a cohesive distribution of several dozen pieces of open source
mathematics software, with almost no external dependencies,
which can easily be built completely from source
with one command on OS~X, Linux, 
and Windows.  Creating this distribution has required the combined
work of numerous specialists in the arcane build processes
of different operating systems, and requires regular
maintenance (which would be funded by this proposal)
to remain up to date.  The PI has often been
told by mathematicians that various open source
programs, e.g., PARI and Singular, can
easily be built as part of Sage, but are ``impossibly difficult''
for them to build without Sage.

``I would like to thank everyone who responded to my question 
about installing PARI on an iMAC.
The consensus was that it would be simplest to install Sage, 
which includes PARI and many other things.
I tried this and it worked! 

Thanks!

\subsection{Prior Support}

The PI's have used his startup money at UC San Diego and University of Washington, 
his NSF grants (DMS-0555776, [[add more]]), and the UW's NSF VIGRE grant to
support xxx Sage workshops, xxx undergraduate employees, four graduate 
students, and research visitors. Add more...

{\bf Other Grant Applications:} xxx has also applied this year to
the NSF COMPMATH program to fund ...
