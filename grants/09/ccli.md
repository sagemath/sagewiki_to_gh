= CCLI 2009 Proposal =


This is the wiki page for the CCLI 2009 proposal that Jason Grout, Rob Beezer, Kiran Kedlaya, and William Stein, are putting together (through AIM) to get support for the Sage project. 

NSF guidelines: http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2009/nsf09529/nsf09529.html

== 18 Aug Conference Call ==

This is fleshed out from William's email:

  * Dissemination is an important point in the proposal to think seriously about.
    * what conferences people are going to present these results at

    * exactly how you are going to tell people about your products

  * Some deliverables

    * translate various appendices of books that contain code for the 4Ms to Sage; talk with author about including these in the textbook

    * online textbook with interactive computations

    * A system for easily producing such interactive textbooks

    * webwork integration

    * don't make windows port a delivarable

  * don't ask for something unless you want it.

  * ask for as much as we can to say


  * tim bogart -- NSF funded guided discovery in combinatorics

  * we're the guinnea pigs; now it's time to get lots of other people up
  and running

  * high minority --

  * get community college classes using sage

  * ed. research about math software helps students

    * http://cm.math.uiuc.edu/studies -- Calculus and Mathematica is a book/course using Mathematica to teach calculus.  This is a page talking about studies related to this course.

    * http://media.wolfram.com/documents/fowler/  -- Wolfram has put some time into compiling research that supports using technology and math software in teaching.

    * http://www.maa.org/columns/launchings/launchings_04_09.html  -- References some studies about the effectiveness of webwork.

  * David Farmer -- just

  * Tom Judson -- http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/webwork.html

  * find out about background

  * circulate a list of delivarables + what it would take to do them

  * what we would like to do behind the scenes.
