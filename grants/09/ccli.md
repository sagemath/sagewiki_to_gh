This is the wiki page for the CCLI 2009 proposal that Jason Grout, Rob Beezer, Kiran Kedlaya, and William Stein, are putting together (through AIM) to get support for the Sage project.

== 18 Aug Conference Call ==

This is fleshed out from William's email:

  * Dissemination is an important point in the proposal to think seriously about.
    * what conferences people are going to present these results at

    * exactly how you are going to tell people about your products

  * Some deliverables

    * translate various appendices of books that contain code for the 4Ms to Sage; talk with author about including these in the textbook

    * online textbook with interactive computations

    * A system for easily producing such interactive textbooks

    * webwork integration

    * don't make windows port a delivarable

  * don't ask for something unless you want it.

  * ask for as much as we can to say


  * Ken Bogart, Dartmouth College -- NSF funded guided discovery in combinatorics (see below)

  * we're the guinnea pigs; now it's time to get lots of other people up
  and running

  * high minority --

  * get community college classes using sage

  * ed. research about math software helps students

    * http://cm.math.uiuc.edu/studies -- Calculus and Mathematica is a book/course using Mathematica to teach calculus.  This is a page talking about studies related to this course.

    * http://media.wolfram.com/documents/fowler/  -- Wolfram has put some time into compiling research that supports using technology and math software in teaching.

    * http://www.maa.org/columns/launchings/launchings_04_09.html  -- References some studies about the effectiveness of webwork.

  * David Farmer -- just

  * Tom Judson -- possible math ed assistance

  * http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/webwork.html

  * find out about background

  * circulate a list of delivarables + what it would take to do them

  * what we would like to do behind the scenes.


== Next Conference call: Tuesday, 25 Aug 2009, 10AM Pacific Time ==


== Brain dump from Nathan Carter ==

Nathan Carter has a Type I grant for writing a piece of software.  He's also been on a review panel for CCLI once and also has been a panel leader once.  These are "brain dump" notes from him during our long conversation at Mathfest about how to write a CCLI proposal.  I'll go through and clean these up soon.

* good writing and organization is key.  What do they want to read first; what questions will they have from that, then answer those right THEN.  Lead the reader through a path of question answer question answer

Criteria:

Intellectual merit: is this a good idea?  Pitch your summary to your colleagues and see what they think.

Broader impact: NSF funds things that have benefit to lots of different types of people, etc.

(two other things that are *critical* to spend lots of time thinking and planning about.  Most people don't, and it makes a huge impact on whether this gets funded)

Dissemination:

In relationship to broader impact, include a plan (3 pages or so) about your dissemination plan.  Specifically, where are you going to go, what are you talking about, why they'll accept you, so:

* put website into math dl
* PREP proposals
* workshop proposals that may be included in the budget.

Evaluation:  For exploratory proposals, it doesn't have to be a formal study of effectiveness.  But it still can't be just "we'll hand students surveys".  You have to be serious about getting impact information

formative evaluation: halfway through, how am I doing and what should I do better.

summative evaluations: at the end, did I succeed.

It needs to be obvious that you care as much about the dissemination and evaluation as the NSF does.

Supplementary letters: get letters from like 10 experts saying that they wish this should be funded.  Why it is valuable, why you should be leading it, etc.  You can shift some of your broader impact, etc. to these letters.

For Sage windows: you have double impact, since you are bringing students in to develop WHILE you are doing the project, instead of waiting until the end.

Pay attention to what happens when you explain the idea to others.  If there is something they are missing, make sure you explain it.  This is the precursor to asking people for comments on your proposal.




A helpful thing: seven people that commit to using sage as we go along and are paid honorariums to write tutorials telling how to integrate Sage into their courses.


== Open Textbooks in Mathematics ==

 * Candidates for conversion to Sage notebooks - open licenses, TeX source
   * [[http://linear.pugetsound.edu/|A First Course in Linear Algebra, Beezer]]
   * [[http://abstract.ups.edu/|Abstract Algebra, Theory and Applications, Judson]]
   * [[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/|Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery, Bogart]]
   * Maybe more at [[http://linear.ups.edu/curriculum.html|Open Math Curriculum]]

 * Demonstration Project
   * Make a new account at [[http://sagenb.org|sagenb.org]]
   * Login and click on "Upload" in upper-left
   * Into second box cut/paste the URL:  `http://buzzard.ups.edu/sage/sage-group-theory-primer.sws`
   * Click on "Upload Worksheet" button
   * Experiment running Sage cells (click in cell, then click "evaluate" below)
   * Search on the phrase "default=12" to find interactive Sage cell
   * Evaluate the cell, then vary group order to see all subgroups of a cyclic group
   * This tutorial was authored in LaTeX, then converted with software tools to a Sage worksheet
   * PDF version of worksheet, and more, at [[Abstract Algebra textbook site|http://abstract.ups.edu/sage-aata.html]]
   * Most of the translation is via [[tex4ht|http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/]], an NSF funded project
   * Rendering in Sage is via [[jsMath|http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/]]

== MAA Resources ==

 * PREP Workshops for dissemination? Especially for community colleges?  Done virtually, there would be no travel expenses for participants.  http://www.maa.org/prep/
 * MAA wiki on WebWork.  Note NSF funding.  http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Main_Page
 * National Problem Library for WebWork (12,000 problems)  http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/National_Problem_Library
 * Michael Pearson, MAA Director of Programs and Services, http://www.maa.org/aboutmaa/pearsonbio.html
