== Important Dates ==
See the GSoC2009 FAQ for the timeline here http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2009/faqs.html#0_1_timeline_5354032302481437_.

== GSoC Sage Projects ==

All #numbers below refer to [[http://trac.sagemath.org|trac tickets]].

== Notes: ==

We should take care to define delivarables for the items below. These should be doable with less than 3 months of work.

Here is what the FAQ says for "Ideas" lists:

  An "Ideas" list should be a list of suggested student projects. This list is meant to introduce contributors to your project's needs and to provide inspiration to would-be student applicants. It is useful to classify each idea as specifically as possible, e.g. "must know Python" or "easier project; good for a student with more limited experience with C++." If your organization plans to provide an application template, you should include it on your Ideas list.

 Keep in mind that your Ideas list should be a starting point for student applications; we've heard from past mentoring organization participants that some of their best student projects are those that greatly expanded on a proposed idea or were blue-sky proposals not mentioned on the Ideas list at all. 

=== Notebook ===

The Sage notebook is an AJAX application similar to Google Documents that provides
functionality for all mathematical software somewhat like Mathematica notebooks. 
It was written from scratch (in Javascript and Python) by the Sage development team,
and has been used daily by thousands of people over the last year.  It's one of the
main ''killer features'' of Sage.  This project is about improving the notebook.
No special mathematical knowledge is required.  Knowledge of Javascript, jQuery, Python,
and general AJAX techniques is needed.
