\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. First create a clone branch of sage.  This is in case you do something crazy, and screw up your sage, you can just throw the branch away without deleting all of sage.  To do this, get in your sage directory and in the terminal enter:\
\
./sage -clone test\
\
This will rebuild your sage, and now sage-main will point to your clone branch.  To be sure that this is happening, type:\
\
./sage -branch\
\
It should output "test".\
\
2. Now go into your branch:\
\
cd devel/sage\
\
and set up for mercurial queues: \
\
../../sage -hg qinit\
\
This only needs to be done *once* per installed copy of sage.\
\
2.  Go to trac, find your patch of interest, left click on the download box, and "copy link."   Now you will import it into your sage library:\
\
../../sage -hg qimport <past link>\
\
push it into the stack\
\
../../sage -hg qpush\
\
and rebuild your sage\
\
../../sage -b\
\
Now you have installed the patch into sage!  }
