# Sage Days 44: Overconvergent Modular Forms in Sage

[[_TOC_]] 


## January 31–February 3, 2013, University of Wisconsin, Madison

This workshop will focus on implementing algorithms for _p_-adic overconvergent modular forms and modular symbols in Sage, with applications to computing _p_-adic _L_-functions. 


### Schedule

There will be a few talks, but most of the time will be devoted to working on Sage code. 

Conference activities will begin Thursday morning and conclude Sunday afternoon, so try to fly in on Wednesday afternoon or evening and depart Sunday evening. 

Schedule so far: 

* Thursday, 9:30am–10:45am, Van Vleck B341 &bull; **Robert Pollack** &bull; _An introduction to overconvergent modular symbols_ 
* Thursday, 11am-12pm, Van Vleck 9th floor lounge &bull; _Project planning session_ 
* Thursday, 2:30pm–3:30pm, Van Vleck B129 &bull; **William Stein** &bull; _<a class="http" href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/NTS_Spring_2013/Abstracts#January_31">How explicit is the explicit formula?</a>_ and <a class="http" href="http://wstein.org/talks/2013-madison/">Slides</a>
