= Sage Days 44: Overconvergent Modular Forms in Sage =

<<TableOfContents>>

== January 31â€“February 3, 2013, University of Wisconsin, Madison ==

This workshop will focus on implementing algorithms for ''p''-adic overconvergent modular forms and modular symbols in Sage, with applications to computing ''p''-adic ''L''-functions.

=== Schedule ===

There will be a few talks but most of the time will be devoted to working on Sage code.  A precise schedule of talks is yet to be determined, but will include a talk in the number theory seminar on Thursday at 14:30.

Conference activities will begin Thursday morning and conclude Sunday afternoon, so try to fly in on Wednesday afternoon or evening and depart Sunday evening.
