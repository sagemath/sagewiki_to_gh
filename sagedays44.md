= Sage Days 44: Overconvergent Modular Forms in Sage =

<<TableOfContents>>

== January 31–February 3, 2013, University of Wisconsin, Madison ==

This workshop will focus on implementing algorithms for ''p''-adic overconvergent modular forms and modular symbols in Sage, with applications to computing ''p''-adic ''L''-functions.

=== Schedule ===

There will be a few talks, but most of the time will be devoted to working on Sage code.

Conference activities will begin Thursday morning and conclude Sunday afternoon, so try to fly in on Wednesday afternoon or evening and depart Sunday evening.

Schedule so far:
 *Thursday, 9:30am–10:45am, Van Vleck B341 &bull; '''Robert Pollack''' &bull; ''An introduction to overconvergent modular symbols''
 *Thursday, 11am-12pm, Van Vleck 9th floor lounge &bull; ''Project planning session''
