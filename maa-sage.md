=== Session Description ===

The open source software paradigm provides freely available and freely modifiable software to anyone with an internet connection, including much mathematics software. Some of the most familiar to the math community are LaTeX and the Firefox web browser, but there are many other high-quality projects as well. Two reasons this software is appropriate for use in the undergraduate curriculum are its affordability for institutions where this is a limiting factor, and the ability for advanced students with programming experience to see the inner workings of, contribute to, and improve upon software they constantly use.  This panel will describe and demonstrate a variety of successful uses of open source software in contexts ranging from the introductory classroom to senior projects.

Using Open Source Software for Undergraduate Course, Tuesday 1:00 p.m.–2:20 p.m., organized by Karl-Dieter Crisman, Gordon College; Marshall Hampton, University of Minnesota, Duluth; and David Joyner, United States Naval Academy. The open source software paradigm provides freely available and freely modifiable software to anyone with an internet connection, including much mathematics software. Some of the most familiar to the math community are LaTeX and the Firefox web browser, but there are many other high-quality projects as well. Two reasons this software is appropriate for use in the undergraduate curriculum are its affordability for institutions where this is a limiting factor, and the ability for advanced students with programming experience to see the inner workings of, contribute to, and improve upon software they constantly use. This panel will describe and demonstrate a variety of successful uses of open source software in contexts ranging from the introductory classroom to senior projects. Panelists will include: John Verzani, CUNY, “Introductory Statistics with R”; Michael Gage, University of Rochester, WebWorK; and David Joyner, Differential Equations with Sage.
