Sage Days 38
============

`Sage`__ is a mathematics software package,
developed by and for the mathematics community. It aims to
become a viable alternative to commercial software packages
on the basis of an open-source model.

Theme
-----

This workshop will be a 5-day intensive workshop to serve
both as introduction to Sage and as an open developers
meeting. The event will include a combination of
mathematical talks, tutorials, demonstrations of Sage
functionality as well as time spent on Sage development. The
principal focus of the developers meeting is algebraic
combinatorics and the representation theory of algebras.

Location and Date
-----------------

 * `Centre de recherche mathématique`__, Montréal, Quebec, May 7-11, 2011.

Invited speakers
----------------

* Meinolf Geck, University of Aberdeen
* Florent Hivert, LRI, Université Paris-Sud
* Anne Schilling, University of California Davis
* Øyvind Solberg, Norwegian University of Science and Technology
* Nicolas Thiéry, LMO, Université Paris-Sud


Who should attend
-----------------

You! A specific goal of the workshop is to provide a venue
for faculty, graduate students and undergraduate students to
learn more about the software. This will make it accessible
to researchers at all levels, *even those without any prior
experience with Sage*. Since it will be held in May, it is
an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students
embarking on summer research projects and graduate students
looking to incorporate scientific computation into their
research projects.

Registration and financial support
----------------------------------

Online registration will be available starting at the end of
February through the official CRM website. In the meantime,
you can express your intention to participate by completing
the following questionnaire:
