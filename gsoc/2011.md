# Google Summer of Code 2011

This is the main organization page for the <a class="http" href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> efforts of the <a class="http" href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a> project. 

[[_TOC_ 4]] 


## Introduction

Sage is an open-source mathematical software system which combines <a class="http" href="http://www.sagemath.org/links-components.html">numerous packages</a> under one umbrella with the goal to provide an alternative to major proprietary mathematical software systems (aka the Ma*'s). The software included in Sage use many different languages such as C, C++, Fortran. However, <a class="http" href="http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/">the Sage library</a> which provides a unified interface to these components besides implementions of novel mathematical algoritms is written in <a class="http" href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and <a class="http" href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a>. Sage also includes a <a class="http" href="http://nb.sagemath.org/">web-based user interface</a> where worksheets are stored for each user.  

With it's friendly development community and diverse challenges including  

* linking together software systems intended to be used through a command line interface, 
* efficient implementation of novel mathematical ideas,  
* making sure all the components build without problems on a wide range of platforms, and 
* providing a web-based user interface for easy experimentation and collaboration in mathematics 
Sage provides projects that might appeal to contributors with different interests and skill levels. 

**If you're a student** interested in working on any of the <a href="/GSoC/2011#projects">projects</a> described below, note that these are mostly rough ideas. Feel free to ask questions or suggest other projects by writing to <a class="http" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel">sage-devel@googlegroups.com</a>. Here is the <a href="/gsoc/proposal_template">student application template</a> we recommend students to use for their application. 

**If you're a Sage developer**, please take some time to organize the list below and add more ideas. Follow guidelines from the <a class="http" href="http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/faqs">GSOC FAQ</a> page. These projects should be doable with less than 3 months of full time work. Projects should generally have: 

                     * a brief explanation 
                     * the expected results, way to measure success 
                     * pre-requisites for working on the project  
                     * names of possible mentors (primary one plus backup), information on how to contact them 

## Important Dates

Here is the <a class="http" href="http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline">original timeline</a>. Some highlights:
