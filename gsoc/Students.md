Hello and welcome to SageMath's (or Sage for short) GSoC guide for students!

We are glad that you are interested in participating in GSoC with Sage and we look forward to working with you. On this page, you will find numerous application details and links to resources that can help you quickly set up Sage and get started.

You can explore the [[GSoC/2017|GSoC 2017 Ideas Page]] for information on potential projects.

== What is Sage? ==

Sage is a GPL open-source mathematical software system. It is designed to be not just a computer algebra system, but more like a complete environment for doing mathematics and related calculations. It is based on a vast collection of existing open-source software tools and libraries and ties them together via Python.  Python is also the primary interface language for the user and its object-oriented way of expressing concepts is used to express calculations - of course, there are also many “normal” functions available. Behind the scenes, the Sage library executes the commands and calculations by its own algorithms or by accessing appropriate routines from the included software packages. On top of that, there are various ways for users to interact with Sage, most notably via a dynamic web-site called “Notebook”.

Sage works hand-in-hand with other computational mathematics software systems, such as SymPy, GAP, etc, and can serve as an umbrella organization for GSOC projects for those sister projects.
