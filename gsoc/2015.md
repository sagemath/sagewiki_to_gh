 * new notebook modes that force execution from top to bottom for reproducible computations
 * native GUI ([[https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/|Spyder]])
 * Generic framework to choose between different implementations of algorithms. In Sage there are various places where we have several possibilities to execute a task (e.g. calling pari or gap). It would be interesting to have a way of choosing the default parameters by performing benchmarkings at build time. That would also allow to check coherency between various implementations.
