== Improve (free) module implementations ==

|| Mentor     || Travis Scrimshaw ||
|| Area       || Linear Algebra, Performance, Refactoring ||
|| Skills     || Understanding of linear algebra and object-oriented programming. Cython experience is highly recommended. ||
|| Length     || 175 hours ||
|| Difficulty || Medium-easy ||

SageMath has multiple implementations of free modules:

1. Finite dimensional coordinate representations in the "standard" basis using `FreeModule` that provides both a dense and sparse implementation.
2. Using `CombinatorialFreeModule` (CFM) as (possibly infinite dimensional) sparse vectors.

There are various benefits to each implementation. However, they are largely disjoint and would mutually benefit from having a common base classes. In particular, having a dense implementation for CFM elements for applications that require heavier use of (dense) linear algebra. The goal of this project is to refactor these classes to bring them closer together (although they will likely remain separate as they are likely not fully compatible implementations for the parents).


== Rewrite exterior algebra and implement Gröbner bases ==

|| Mentor     || Travis Scrimshaw, Vic Reiner ||
|| Area       || Algebra, Performance ||
|| Skills     || Understanding of abstract algebra and Cython. Knowledge of Gröbner basis is recommended. ||
|| Length     || 175 hour and 350 hour variants ||
|| Difficulty || Medium-hard ||

The exterior (or Grassmann) algebra is a fundamental object in mathematics, in particular with applications to physics and geometry. It could be considered as the closest non-commutative analog of polynomials where the variables skew-commute with each other. The current implementation uses a basis indexed by subsets (as tuples), but a more efficient version would be indexed by integers encoding membership by the binary string. The first goal is to do this change ([[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32369|#32369]]). The second goal of this project would be to implement an algorithm for Gröbner basis for their ideals in order to construct quotient algebras. A variation of this project would be to improve the implementation of commutative graded algebras to not rely on the more generic [[https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-2/sing_469.htm|plural]] for computations (except perhaps those involving ideals). For the ambitious, these computations would be extracted to an independent C++ library for many common rings (implemented using other libraries).


== Implement Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials ==

|| Mentor     || Travis Scrimshaw ||
|| Area       || Algebra, Combinatorics, Schubert Calculus ||
|| Skills     || Foundations in combinatorics, experience reading research papers. ||
|| Length     || 175 hours ||
|| Difficulty || Medium-hard ||

Schubert calculus can roughly be stated as the study of the intersections of lines, through which certain algebras arise that can be represented using Schubert polynomials and Grothendieck polynomials. The main goal of this project is to finish the implementation started in [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/6629|#6629]], as well as implement the symmetric Grothendieck polynomials and their duals in symmetric functions.

== Tensor operations in Sage using Python libraries as backends ==

|| Area       || Linear/multilinear algebra ||
|| Skills     || Solid knowledge of linear algebra, Python experience, ideally experience with numpy, !PyTorch, JAX, or !TensorFlow ||
|| Length     || 350 hours ||
|| Difficulty || Hard ||

In this project, we develop new backends for the [[https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/tensor_modules.html|tensor modules from the SageManifolds project]]. Amongst the goals of the project are such elements as a [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30308|fast implementation of tensor operations using numpy]] and [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30096|using TensorFlow Core and PyTorch]].

The simplest example of a function is given by univariate polynomials such as `P(x) = x^3 - 2*x + 3`. A more complex function is `F: (x, y) -> (cos(sqrt(x) + 1) * sin(y), tan(x^2 + 2) + y)`. For this project we are interested in making the evaluation of such expression at given concrete values fast and reliable. SageMath already has a "compiler" for symbolic expression that is used through `fast_callable`
{{{
sage: x, y = SR.var('x,y')
sage: f = cos(sqrt(x) + 1) * sin(y)
sage: g = fast_callable(f, vars=[x,y], domain=float)
sage: g(2.3, 3.5)
0.2844686555174862
}}}

The objective of this project is to rewrite the code for fast callable using the more modern project [[https://github.com/symengine/symengine|symengine]]. Doing so the applicant is likely to contribute to both symengine and SageMath projects. Here is a potential list of subtasks

 0. '''make sage code compatible with symengine'''

    Some algorithms in sage do use `fast_callable` (such as integration routine, numerical differential equations solver, computation of geodesics on manifolds, ...). For each of them, one need to check whether the `symengine` functions can be used as a drop-in replacement and possibly adapt the sage code. Documentation and tests should be adapted accordingly.

 1. '''add support for more data types in symengine''' (in order to support more sage types)

    * Making numpy arrays support more types such as
      * integers ([[https://gmplib.org/|GMP]] `mpz_t` and [[http://www.flintlib.org/|flint]] `fmpz_t`)
      * rationals ([[https://gmplib.org/|GMP]] `mpq_t` and [[http://www.flintlib.org/|flint]] `fmpq_t`)
      * real numbers ([[https://www.mpfr.org/|MPFR]] `mpfr_t`)
      * intervals ([[https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/mpfi/|MPFI]] `mpfi_t`) and balls ([[http://arblib.org/|arb]] `arb_t` and `acb_t`)

    An example of such implementation are the [[https://github.com/moble/quaternion|quaternions]].

 2. '''optimization'''

    * Time benchmark `fast_callable` against `symengine`

    * Analyzing and optimizing accuracy (for floating points numbers). For example the order of operations do matter for accuracy.

    * Analyzing and optimizing the size of the evaluation tree: given an expression there are plenty of way to evaluate it. For example `P(x, y) = x^4 + 2*x^2*y + 3*x^2 + 2*x*y + 2*y^2 + 2*y + 1` can be evaluated naively. But we can also rewrite it as `P(x,y) = (x^2 + y + 1)^2 + (x + y)^2` and get another evaluation scheme. This problem of determining the optimal evaluation tree is known to be NP-complete.

    * Generate code for multiple input arrays so that compiler can optimize it better.

 3. '''parallelization'''

 * The (now abandoned) project [[http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/|Theano]] might be of interest for optimization.

== Edge connectivity and edge disjoint spanning trees in digraphs ==

|| Mentor     || David Coudert ||
|| Area       || Graph theory ||
|| Skills     || Solid knowledge of graph theory and graph algorithms, Python and C/C++ experience ||
|| Length     || 350 hours ||
|| Difficulty || Hard ||

The current method used for finding edge disjoint spanning trees in directed graphs (digraphs) relies on mixed integer linear programming and it may fail on some instances (see [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32169|ticket #32169]]). The problem has been fixed for undirected graphs, implementing a combinatorial algorithm (see [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32911|ticket #32911]]).
The goal of this project is to implement combinatorial algorithms for finding edge disjoint spanning trees in digraphs. We will particularly consider the following algorithm:

== Improve Height Functionality ==

|| Mentor     || Ben Hutz and Alex Galarraga||
|| Area       || Algebraic Geometry ||
|| Skills     || Python experience, abstract algebra, basic algebraic geometry, number theory ||
|| Length     || 175 hours ||
|| Difficulty || Medium Hard ||

There are some issues with the current implementations of heights in Sage

 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32687|#32687]] error in height difference bound
 * [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32686|#32686]] points_of_bounded_height for projective space is incorrect
 * A very advanced student could also finish [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21129|#21129]] Arakelov-Zhang pairing of rational maps

Related to [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32687|#32687]] is implementing the more efficient algorithm from Krumm from the paper mentioned in that ticket.
