## Improve (free) module implementations
 Mentor      |  Travis Scrimshaw 
 Area        |  Linear Algebra, Performance, Refactoring 
 Skills      |  Understanding of linear algebra and object-oriented programming. Cython experience is highly recommended. 
 Length      |  175 hours 
 Difficulty  |  Medium-easy 

<a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> has multiple implementations of free modules: 

1. Finite dimensional coordinate representations in the "standard" basis using `FreeModule` that provides both a dense and sparse implementation. 2. Using `CombinatorialFreeModule` (CFM) as (possibly infinite dimensional) sparse vectors. 

There are various benefits to each implementation. However, they are largely disjoint and would mutually benefit from having a common base classes. In particular, having a dense implementation for CFM elements for applications that require heavier use of (dense) linear algebra. The goal of this project is to refactor these classes to bring them closer together (although they will likely remain separate as they are likely not fully compatible implementations for the parents). 


## Rewrite exterior algebra and implement Gröbner bases
 Mentor      |  Travis Scrimshaw, Vic Reiner 
 Area        |  Algebra, Performance 
 Skills      |  Understanding of abstract algebra and Cython. Knowledge of Gröbner basis is recommended. 
 Length      |  175 hour and 350 hour variants 
 Difficulty  |  Medium-hard 

The exterior (or Grassmann) algebra is a fundamental object in mathematics, in particular with applications to physics and geometry. It could be considered as the closest non-commutative analog of polynomials where the variables skew-commute with each other. The current implementation uses a basis indexed by subsets (as tuples), but a more efficient version would be indexed by integers encoding membership by the binary string. The first goal is to do this change (<a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32369">#32369</a>). The second goal of this project would be to implement an algorithm for Gröbner basis for their ideals in order to construct quotient algebras. A variation of this project would be to improve the implementation of commutative graded algebras to not rely on the more generic <a class="https" href="https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-2/sing_469.htm">plural</a> for computations (except perhaps those involving ideals). For the ambitious, these computations would be extracted to an independent C++ library for many common rings (implemented using other libraries). 


## Implement Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials
 Mentor      |  Travis Scrimshaw 
 Area        |  Algebra, Combinatorics, Schubert Calculus 
 Skills      |  Foundations in combinatorics, experience reading research papers. 
 Length      |  175 hours 
 Difficulty  |  Medium-hard 

Schubert calculus can roughly be stated as the study of the intersections of lines, through which certain algebras arise that can be represented using Schubert polynomials and Grothendieck polynomials. The main goal of this project is to finish the implementation started in <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/6629">#6629</a>, as well as implement the symmetric Grothendieck polynomials and their duals in symmetric functions. 


## Tensor operations in Sage using Python libraries as backends
 Mentor      |  Matthias Koeppe 
 Area        |  Linear/multilinear algebra 
 Skills      |  Solid knowledge of linear algebra, Python experience, ideally experience with numpy, PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow 
 Length      |  350 hours 
 Difficulty  |  Hard 

In this project, we develop new backends for the <a class="https" href="https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/tensor_modules.html">tensor modules from the SageManifolds project</a>. Amongst the goals of the project are such elements as a <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30308">fast implementation of tensor operations using numpy</a> and <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30096">using TensorFlow Core and PyTorch</a>.

See <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26511">Meta-ticket #26511: Use Python optimization interfaces: cvxpy, PuLP, Pyomo, cylp...</a> 


## Fast evaluation of symbolic expressions
 Mentor      |  Vincent Delecroix and Isuru Fernando 
 Area        |  Symbolic expression 
 Skills      |  Basic math background in algebra and analysis. Fluent in Python and C/C++. Knowledge of compilers, Cython, or parallelization (openmp) would be useful. 
 Length      |  350 hours 
 Difficulty  |  Medium 

The simplest example of a function is given by univariate polynomials such as `P(x) = x^3 - 2*x + 3`. A more complex function is `F: (x, y) -> (cos(sqrt(x) + 1) * sin(y), tan(x^2 + 2) + y)`. For this project we are interested in making the evaluation of such expression at given concrete values fast and reliable. <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> already has a "compiler" for symbolic expression that is used through `fast_callable` 
```txt
sage: x, y = SR.var('x,y')
sage: f = cos(sqrt(x) + 1) * sin(y)
sage: g = fast_callable(f, vars=[x,y], domain=float)
sage: g(2.3, 3.5)
0.2844686555174862
```
The objective of this project is to rewrite the code for fast callable using the more modern project <a class="https" href="https://github.com/symengine/symengine">symengine</a>. Doing so the applicant is likely to contribute to both symengine and <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> projects. Here is a potential list of subtasks 

1. **make sage code compatible with symengine** 
         * Some algorithms in sage do use `fast_callable` (such as integration routine, numerical differential equations solver, computation of geodesics on manifolds, ...). For each of them, one need to check whether the `symengine` functions can be used as a drop-in replacement and possibly adapt the sage code. Documentation and tests should be adapted accordingly. 
1. **add support for more data types in symengine** (in order to support more sage types) 
         * Making numpy arrays support more types such as 
               * integers (<a class="https" href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> `mpz_t` and <a class="http" href="http://www.flintlib.org/">flint</a> `fmpz_t`) 
               * rationals (<a class="https" href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> `mpq_t` and <a class="http" href="http://www.flintlib.org/">flint</a> `fmpq_t`) 
               * real numbers (<a class="https" href="https://www.mpfr.org/">MPFR</a> `mpfr_t`) 
               * intervals (<a class="https" href="https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/mpfi/">MPFI</a> `mpfi_t`) and balls (<a class="http" href="http://arblib.org/">arb</a> `arb_t` and `acb_t`) 
An example of such implementation are the <a class="https" href="https://github.com/moble/quaternion">quaternions</a>. 

1. **optimization** 
         * Time benchmark `fast_callable` against `symengine` 
         * Analyzing and optimizing accuracy (for floating points numbers). For example the order of operations do matter for accuracy. 
         * Analyzing and optimizing the size of the evaluation tree: given an expression there are plenty of way to evaluate it. For example `P(x, y) = x^4 + 2*x^2*y + 3*x^2 + 2*x*y + 2*y^2 + 2*y + 1` can be evaluated naively. But we can also rewrite it as `P(x,y) = (x^2 + y + 1)^2 + (x + y)^2` and get another evaluation scheme. This problem of determining the optimal evaluation tree is known to be NP-complete. 
         * Generate code for multiple input arrays so that compiler can optimize it better. 
1. **parallelization** 
Related projects 

* <a class="https" href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/codegen.html">sympy codegen</a>. 
* The (now abandoned) project <a class="http" href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a> might be of interest for optimization. 

## Edge connectivity and edge disjoint spanning trees in digraphs
 Mentor      |  David Coudert 
 Area        |  Graph theory 
 Skills      |  Solid knowledge of graph theory and graph algorithms, Python and C/C++ experience 
 Length      |  350 hours 
 Difficulty  |  Hard 

The current method used for finding edge disjoint spanning trees in directed graphs (digraphs) relies on mixed integer linear programming and it may fail on some instances (see <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32169">ticket #32169</a>). The problem has been fixed for undirected graphs, implementing a combinatorial algorithm (see <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32911">ticket #32911</a>). The goal of this project is to implement combinatorial algorithms for finding edge disjoint spanning trees in digraphs. We will particularly consider the following algorithms:

 Skills      |  Python experience, abstract algebra, basic algebraic geometry, number theory 
 Length      |  175 hours

There are some issues with the current implementations of heights in Sage 

* <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32687">#32687</a> error in height difference bound 
* <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32686">#32686</a> points_of_bounded_height for projective space is incorrect 
* A very advanced student could also finish <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21129">#21129</a> Arakelov-Zhang pairing of rational maps 
Related to <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32687">#32687</a> is implementing the more efficient algorithm from Krumm from the paper mentioned in that ticket. 


## Implementation of generalizations of RSK algorithm
 Mentor      |  Tomohiro Sasamoto 
 Area        |  Combinatorics, Probability Theory

 Length      |  175 hours

In Sage, the classical RSK algorithm is implemented. Such algorithm admits extensions as Sagan and Stanley's version, which puts in bijection pairs of skew tableaux with matrices of sequences. Another extension of the RSK is given by a recent algorithm by Imamura, Mucciconi and Sasamoto.  

As these generalizations of the RSK are not yet available in Sage we aim to implement them. The project will include creating new combinatorial operations on tableaux and new realization of Kashiwara operators. We also aim at creating Sage functions with which one can visualize such new operations.
