# About this wiki

**Editing the wiki.** Page editing uses the <a href="/MoinMoin">MoinMoin</a> syntax. To edit the wiki, you will need a log in using your <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/#legacy-account-request">legacy sage-trac account</a> account; a GitHub account cannot be used for this. Since it _is_ a wiki, pages should be made to last over many, and frequent, changes. If an external link is made, please attach relevant files/content to avoid broken links. If you edit an existing page with a long history, a key question is: "If someone opens this page tomorrow, will they be able to tell which information is current and which is outdated?" Edit accordingly. 

**<a href="/SageWiki">SageWiki</a> maintenance.** The <a href="/SageWikiMaintenance%20page">SageWikiMaintenance page</a> attempts to reorganize the wiki, which has accumulated many outdated pages. <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33725">Pages related to development are being transferred to the Trac wiki or merged in our developer guide.</a>
