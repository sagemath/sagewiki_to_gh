= SageMath Wiki =

This is the wiki for the [[https://www.sagemath.org|Sage - Mathematics Software System]] project. There are other [[ThingsCalledSage]].

This wiki is mainly used by developers for organization of e.g. SageDays and discussion of long-term projects. Since it ''is'' a wiki, pages should be made to last over many, and frequent, changes. If an external link is made, please attach relevant files/content to avoid broken links.

[[https://zulip.sagemath.org | Zulip]] group chat server for realtime collaboration on Sage (like Slack).  Fairly low-activity but more than IRC.

[[IRC]] channel: {{{#sagemath}}} on [[https://freenode.net/|freenode ]] (`chat.freenode.net`)

The Sage website contains links to [[https://www.sagemath.org/development-groups.html | other discussion mailing lists]].

= Development =

Development is handled using "tickets" on the [[https://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/|trac server]].

The main developer doc is the [[https://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/ | Developers' Guide]].

Release notes (higher level than change logs) are collaboratively prepared at [[ReleaseTours]].

= Packages =

== New-style SPKGs ==

There is a single authoritative place to learn about the 
specific set of packages (new-style SPKGs) that Sage uses: The 
[[https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/build/pkgs|SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/]] directory
in the Sage distribution.  Each SPKG is represented by a subdirectory. The structure
of these subdirectories is explained in 
the [[https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html|Developer's Guide|]].

Since Sage 9.2, the [[https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/|spkg section of the Sage reference manual]] is automatically generated from the information in `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/`. ([[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29655|Trac #29655]] improves the formatting of this information.)

Use the following shell commands below to access the information from the `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs`
directory of your copy of Sage:

 * Standard packages: `./sage -standard`
 * Installed packages: `./sage -installed`
 * Optional packages available: `./sage -optional`
 * Experimental packages available: `./sage -experimental`
 * Details about an SPKG: `./sage -info <SPKG>`

For some advanced package tools, use `./sage -package`

== External packages ==
