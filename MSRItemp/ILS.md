   Title: What you need to know about random matrix theory

 * 23 Feb in Baker boardroom, Andrew Knightly, Title: Petersson's fomula and related topics,

   
    Abstract: A crucial ingredient in the ILS paper is an estimate for a sum of Hecke eigenvalues.  This is handled using a variant of the trace formula due to Petersson, but there are some obstacles, especially the fact that Petersson's formula includes the contribution of old forms.  I will briefly outline the ILS strategy for isolating the newform contribution when N is square-free.  I will then propose an alternate strategy coming from representation theory.  Along the way, I will give a very basic introduction to the trace formula, and explain how one can use it to derive various identities of interest in classical analytic number theory. These include:
             The trace of a Hecke operator;

             The Petersson and Kuznetsov formulas;
             
             Formulas for averages/moments of L-functions;

             Vertical Sato-Tate laws for Hecke eigenvalues.

    If there is time, I will describe work in progress with Charles Li in which we use the simple supercuspidal representations discovered recently by Gross and Reeder to spectrally isolate newforms (holomorphic or Maass) of level N^3, where N is square-free.  One consequence is a simple Petersson formula for such newforms.

 * 2nd March: Duc Khiem Huynh in Simons Auditorium, Title: Lower order terms for the one-level density of elliptic curve L-functions

   Abstract: The L-function ratios conjectures - motivated by analogous random matrix theorems - give precise predictions for averages over families
of ratios of products of shifted L-functions. We present an application by deriving lower order terms for the one-level density of elliptic curve L-functions. We discuss how these terms together with other arithmetical information can model elliptic curve L-functions in terms of random matrices.

 * 9th March: Kaneenika Sinha in Baker boardroom, Title: Analytic rank of $J_0(q)$ 

   Abstract: We will survey different methods of finding explicit upper bounds for the analytic rank of the Jacobian of the modular curve $X_0(N),$ based on the independent papers of Brumer, Murty, Iwaniec-Luo-Sarnak and Michel-Kowalski.
