 * Februay 14th, Daniel Kane: "A problem related to the ABC conjecture "
 .
 . Abstract: The ABC conjecture says roughly that the equation A+B=C has no solutions among highly divisible relatively prime positive integers A,B,C.  If we weaken what is meant by "highly divisible", there are solutions and we instead find conjectures on the asymptotic number of such solutions.  In this talk we discuss techniques for extending the range in which these conjectures are known to be true.

 * March 14th, Kevin Wilson: "Elliptic curves of arbitrarily large rank"
  
 . Subtitle: Over Function Fields

 . Abstract: Ulrich constructed a family of elliptic curves over function fields which (provably!) attain arbitrarily large rank. I'll go over his construction and the facts about function fields which make proving such statements "easier".

 * March 28th, Gagan Sekhon: "Galois properties of points of finite order of an elliptic curve"
 .
 . Abstract: I will be presenting a paper by Serre, which proves that the Galois group associated to points of finite order of an elliptic curve are "as big as possible". More concretely, given an elliptic curve E/K without complex multiplication, where K is a number field, the Galois representation associated to the action on p-torsion points of E is surjective for almost all but finitely many primes p.
