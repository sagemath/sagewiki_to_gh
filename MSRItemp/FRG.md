This all involves adding data to http://db.modform.org. 

   * computing 2-selmer ranks for Stein-Watkins (146 million curves)
   * first 100 zeros of L(E,s) for millions of E's
   * aplist for all curves in Stein-Watkins   (application: find congruences)
   * add in twists of curves in Stein-Watkins 
   * new database of elliptic curves over Q(sqrt(5))
