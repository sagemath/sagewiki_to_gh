== Cohen-Lenstra heuristics ==

 * Informal reading group on the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics
 * chair: Bjorn Poonen
 * The first meeting of the reading group was Tuesday, January 25, 11-12. 
 * The second meeting will be Tuesday, February 8, 11-12 in the 2nd floor seminar room if that room is available.  It will focus on heuristics for Shafarevich-Tate groups.
