$L$-functions  (attached to modular forms and/or to algebraic varieties and
algebraic number fields) are prominent in quite a wide range of number
theoretic issues, and our recent growth of understanding of the analytic
properties of $L$-functions has already lead to profound applications regarding
( among other things) the statistics related to arithmetic problems.  Much of
this exciting development involves a coming-together of {\it arithmetic
algebraic geometry}, of  {\it automorphic forms and representation theory}, of
{\it analytic number theory} and of  {\it  statistics} (such as  the
statistical heuristics obtained from the contemporary work regarding Random
Matrices).

The semester long program at the MSRI on Arithmetic Statistics emphasizes
the statistical aspects of $L$-functions, modular forms, and associated
arithmetic and algebraic objects from several different
perspectives- theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental.

The program brings together experts on modular forms, analytic number
theory, arithmetic and algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, and
computational number theory to investigate several difficult problems in number
theory from the point of view of understanding their limiting behaviour.

Several factors make this an appropriate time for a program devoted to
statistical questions in number theory.

In recent years, progress has been made on the
problem of obtaining the asymptotic number, $N_{K,n}(X)$, of extensions
of a fixed number field $K$
of given degree $n$ and discriminant $\leq X$. The case of $K={\mathbb Q}$ and $n=3$
is a classical result of Heilbronn and Davenport.
Bhargava has made significant
progress on this problem, obtaining the asympotics, for $\mathbb Q$ and
$n=4,5$.  This work makes use of the theory
of the classification of prehomogenous vector spaces.

Very recently, Bhargava and Shankar have managed to apply the methods used
for number fields to study the asymptotic distribution of ranks of elliptic
curves of a number field. ELABORATE..., AND CONNECT UP
WITH THE PREDICTIONS FROM RMT, AND SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ADJUSTING
DELAUNAY's COHEN-LENSTRA HEURISTICS FOR QUADRATIC TWISTS.

The Sato-Tate conjecture for the case of a modular form associated to an
elliptic curve over ${\mathbb Q}$ with somewhere multiplicative reduction was
recently proven by Clozel, Harris, Shepherd-Barron, and Taylor. We would like
to consider more specific questions such as the rate of convergence to the
Sato-Tate distribution.

The Katz and Sarnak philosophy on the spectral nature of $L$-functions,
specifically through function field analogues and connections to the classical
compact groups, has opened up the world of $L$-functions to detailed
probabilistic modeling. This has yielded tremendous success in providing
detailed models for the statistics of the zeros and values of $L$-functions,
but much work remains to be done, for example, to incorporate subtle arithmetic
information into these models. For instance, to understand the distribution of
ranks of elliptic curves, statistics of the Tate-Shafarevich groups and their
interaction with regulators must be studied and incorporated.

We also wish to understand the lower order terms and uniform asymptotics in
these statistics so as to be able to make precise predictions, for example,
regarding the maximum size of the Riemann zeta function.

During our program we are also extending work to cover higher degree
$L$-functions. While the theory of degree 1 and 2 $L$-functions has reached a
more mature form, much more attention is needed in higher degree.
Furthermore, many crucial and central conjectures have received scant, if any,
testing in the case of higher degree, and limited testing in the case of
degrees 1 and 2. For example, the models for the moments of $L$-functions have not yet been
applied or tested for degree three or higher $L$-functions.

Higher degree $L$-functions arise in many natural ways.  Sometimes they arise from operations performed on lower degree $L$-functions (e.g., symmetric squares) and sometimes they arise from objects that are, in a sense, more complicated.  For example Siegel modular and paramodular forms have natural degree 4 and degree 5 $L$-functions.  In order to study these $L$-functions numerically, one needs to be able to compute their Dirichlet series coefficients; in order to compute their Dirichlet series coefficients, one needs to be able to compute data about the underlying modular form.  A group of us will be developing and implementing algorithms to compute these modular forms and their associated $L$-functions.  The computation of Siegel modular forms, for example, is much hard that computing modular forms on ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and is much more {\it ad hoc}.

One might want to evaluate a higher degree $L$-function in order to, for example, compute the first few zeros on the critical line or central values of quadratic twists of $L$-functions.  Doing such an evaluation is typically limited by the number of Dirichlet series coefficients, a number which, for Siegel modular forms, at least, is usually pretty small.  So, another group of us is going to be investigating methods to evaluate $L$-functions optimally. 

Central values of twists of $L$-functions is a question that has been well studied for degree 2 $L$-functions and is mostly untouched for higher degree $L$-functions.  A project being carried out by our group is to compute a great number of twists of degree 4 $L$-functions to verify interesting conjectures that arise from Random Matrix Theory and others that arise as generalizations of results for the modular forms associated to lower degree $L$-functions.
