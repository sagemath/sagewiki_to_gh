The Arithmetics Statistic postdoc seminar, organized by Jonathan Bober and Kaneenika Sinha, meets Mondays
from 10 to 10:50 a.m. The Free Boundary Problems postdoc seminar meets immediately afterwards, and then
MSRI will have pizza for us at 12.

 * February 4th, Andrew Yang: "Low-Lying zeros of Dedekind zeta functions"
 .
 . Abstract: The Katz-Sarnak philosophy asserts that to any "naturally defined family" of L-functions, there should be an associated symmetry group which determines the distribution of the low-lying zeros (as well as other statistics) of those L-functions.  We consider the family of Dedekind zeta functions of cubic number fields, and we predict that the associated symmetry group is symplectic.  There are three main ingredients: the explicit formula, work of Davenport-Heilbronn on counting cubic fields and the proportion of fields in which rational primes have given splitting type, and power-saving error terms for these counts, first obtained by Belabas-Bhargava-Pomerance.
