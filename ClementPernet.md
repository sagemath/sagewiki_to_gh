=== Stuff I have done/been working on during Sage Dev 1 ===

== LinBox 1.1.6 rc0 ==

 * tried several ways of getting rid of gmp++ (required for debianization). ==> rely on Givaro's
 * integrated Sage's linbox_wrap interface in the LinBox library
 * fixing bugs,...

== Dense Linear Algebra over GF(2) ==
 * Design of the Matrix Multiply based Echelon decomposition
 * learned a lot on the design and tricks of M4RI
 * already done 
   * TSRM, 
   * generalization of matrix windows and algorithms working on them, to any dimensions
== Benchmark(et)ing ==
 * parallel ATLAS and fflas-ffpack: 70 Gffops
 * lobbying for introduction of Tbops for benchmaring M4RI

== Playing with words ==
 * some nicer prononciations for weird acronyms: M4RI and eMPIRe
