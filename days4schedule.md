We have the following locations reserved:
 * [http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?MEB MEB] (Mechanical Engineering Building) Room 238, 7:00am-10:00pm
 * [http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?PDL PDL] (Padelford) Room C36, late
 * PDL C401, late
 * William's Office: PDL C423, all hours  (very very low occupancy)
 * SAGE Lab: [http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?SIG SIG] (Sieg Hall) 312, all building hours (UW people have keys to room door, but our key card access is inactive)

Unless otherwise stated, everything 7am - 10pm will take place in MEB 238.  Later-night coding sprints will take place in one of the above Padelford locations or the SAGE Lab (provided we have at least one person in Sieg after it closes).
