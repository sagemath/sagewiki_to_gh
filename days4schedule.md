= Daily schedule =

We have the following locations reserved:
 * [http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?MEB MEB] (Mechanical Engineering Building) Room 328, 7:00am-10:00pm
 * [http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?PDL PDL] (Padelford) Room C36, late
 * PDL C401, late
 * William's Office: PDL C423, all hours  (very very low occupancy)
 * SAGE Lab: [http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?SIG SIG] (Sieg Hall) 312, all building hours (UW people have keys to room door, but our key card access is inactive)

Unless otherwise stated, the daytime (talks and sprints before dinner) sessions will take place in MEB 328, and late-night coding sprints will take place in one of the above Padelford locations and the SAGE Lab, provided we have at least one person in Sieg after it closes.
