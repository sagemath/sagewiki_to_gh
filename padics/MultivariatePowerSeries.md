* _Goal_ -- Continue to improve multivariate power series, building on the work in #1956. Create the ability to work with different precision types for multivariate power series and laurent series.  
* _Type_ -- precision handling

## Discussion

We should have a discussion about what multivariable laurent series are, and what the right way to handle precision for them is.
