* _Goal_ -- revamp univariate power series rings to hew more closely to the syntax of p-adics (relative and absolute precision; capped-rel, capped-abs and fixed-mod rings types; no more elements of infinite precision (except 0 in a capped-relative ring)  
* _Type_ -- consistency 
* _Priority_ -- Low 
* _Difficulty_ -- Easy 
* _Prerequisites_ -- None 
* _Background_ -- the precision models and inheritance structure in `sage.rings.padics` 
* _Contributors_ --  
* _Progress_ - not started 
* _Related Tickets_ --
