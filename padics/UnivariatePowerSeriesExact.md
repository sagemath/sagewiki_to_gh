 * ''Goal'' -- revamp univariate power series rings to hew more closely to the syntax of p-adics (relative and absolute precision; capped-rel, capped-abs and fixed-mod rings types; no more elements of infinite precision (except 0 in a capped-relative ring) 
 * ''Type'' -- consistency
 * ''Priority'' -- Low
 * ''Difficulty'' -- Easy
 * ''Prerequisites'' -- None
 * ''Background'' -- the precision models and inheritance structure in `sage.rings.padics`
 * ''Contributors'' -- 
 * ''Progress'' - not started
