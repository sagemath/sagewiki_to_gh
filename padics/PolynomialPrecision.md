* _Goal_ -- Finally finish incorporating the changes of #6084, which conceptually splits the precision a polynomial is defined up to from an approximation of the coefficients.  
* _Type_ -- precision handling, speed improvements 
* _Priority_ -- High 
* _Difficulty_ -- Annoying 
* _Prerequisites_ -- None 
* _Background_ --  
* _Contributors_ -- David Roe 
* _Progress_ - I've been almost done with this for a long time now.  At this point the code has bit-rotted to some extent and there are doctests to fix.  It's also going to be a big project to referee 
* _Related Tickets_ --
