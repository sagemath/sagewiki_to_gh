== Frobby for monomial ideals (Bjarke Hammersholt Roune) ==
Frobby is software for computations with monomial ideals, and is included in Sage 3.0.2 as an optional spkg. The current functionality of the Sage interface to Frobby is irreducible decomposition of monomial ideals, while work is on-going to expose more of the capabilities of Frobby, such as Hilbert-Poincare series, primary decomposition and Alexander dual. Frobby is orders of magnitude faster than other programs for many of its computations, primarily owing to an optimized implementation of the Slice Algorithm. See [http://www.broune.com/frobby/] for more on Frobby.
