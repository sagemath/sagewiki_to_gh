= Magma versus Sage =

The point of this page is to list functionality that Magma has and whether Sage has it or not, and if Sage has said functionality, how does the speed compare.  It is basically to answer the question "can Magma still do anything Sage can't", which I often get.

The main reference for what Magma does is [[http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/htmlhelp/MAGMA.htm|the Magma reference manual]].
