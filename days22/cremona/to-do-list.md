== To-do list for elliptic curves in Sage ==

This is a list of things (small or large) which came up during SD22 at MSRI as deserving to be fixed or implemented in Sage.


   1.  Regulators over number fields

   2.  Linear dependencies over number fields

   3.  Finish ticket #8829 on saturation over number fields.

   4.  Kilford's rank function patch #9342:  complete and review.

   5.  Integral points over number fields

   6.  S-integral points over number fields

   7.  S-class groups 

   8.  K-Selmer groups esp.  $K(S,4)$ and $K(S,2)_4$

   9.  All curves with e.g.r.

   10.  All curves with e.g.r. outside S (using most of the above)
