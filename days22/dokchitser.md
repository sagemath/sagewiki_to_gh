= Tim Dokchitser (Cambridge University): Complex L-functions and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture =

== Structure of the course ==

 * Quick review of Elliptic curves over Q and the Mordell-Weil theorem

 * Elliptic curves over finite fields, heuristics for their distribution and the naive version of BSD

 * L-functions of elliptic curves and the BSD-conjecture

 * Root numbers and how to compute them

 * Parity predictions, Goldfeld's conjecture and ranks of elliptic curves over number fields

== Prerequisites ==

Some familiarity with basic algebraic number theory (number fields, primes), and having seen elliptic curves

== Background reading ==

J. H. Silverman, "The arithmetic of elliptic curves", Chapters 3, 7 and 8.

Sage Reference Manual on elliptic curves: [[http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/plane_curves.html]], up to `Isogenies'.

== Computational projects ==

There will be many small problems and larger assignments to play with, illustrating all the concepts and conjectures from the course.
