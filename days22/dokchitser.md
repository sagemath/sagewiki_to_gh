== Structure of the course ==

 - Quick review of Elliptic curves over Q and the Mordell-Weil theorem
 - Elliptic curves over finite fields, heuristics for their distribution and the naive version of BSD
 - L-functions of elliptic curves and the BSD-conjecture
 - Root numbers and how to compute them
 - Parity predictions, Gldfeld's [spelling error on purpose due to antispam filter] conjecture and ranks of elliptic curves over number fields

== Prerequisites ==

Some familiarity with basic algebraic number theory (number fields, primes), and having seen elliptic curves

== Computational projects ==

There will be many small problems and larger assignments to play with, illustrating all the concepts and conjectures from the course
