== Description ==

== Project 1 ==

Tabulating modular elliptic curves over '''Q''' (based on  Chapter II of my book (see below).  The project would be to extend the existing tables from the current conductor limit of $130000$ to something larger, using my C++ code (distributed with Sage) and Sage itself, and some combination of the two.  

One clearly identifiable goal which could be achieved by extending the tables at least as far as $N=234446$ is to verify that the smallest conductor of any curve of rank $4$ is $N=234446$ (which is the smallest known), or find such a curve with smaller conductor in the range $130000<N<234446$.  It is known that there are no such curves of prime conductor (see reference below under Project 4, which pursues this line).  Note that my C++ program has been run with no problem for $N=234446$ itself, and presumably would also work fine for any individual $N$ in this range, but as there are over $100000$ such $N$ this will take a long time, and also require a significant data-prcessing effort to keep track of the computations.

== Project 2 ==


Finding all elliptic curves with good reduction outside a finite set S of primes, over number fields.  The theory, is based on my paper on the subject (see below) which reduces the problem to finding all ''S''-integral points on elliptic curves over number fields, together with some algebraic number theory.   The project would be to implement this in Sage, over number fields.  Over '''Q''', I have already done this, using the ''S''-integral points functions implemented two summers ago.  I also have a partial implementation over number fields in Magma.  Over number fields there will be other challenges, and this is likely to spill over into more general computation of Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves over number fields. 

==== Subproject 1 ====

As a rather specific special case, we could try to find as many examples as possible of elliptic curves with everywhere good reduction (EGR), over quadratic (and higher degree) number fields.  There is some relevant theory here, but in most cases the theory says nothing useful.  As a very explicit example,  my colleague Lassina Dembele would be very happy if we could find for him an elliptic curve with EGR over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{929})$!  I have been trying my hand at that without success.  (We managed 853 and 997.)

==== Subproject 2 ====

Given a number field $K$, a set $S$ of primes of $K$ and a value $j\in K$, compute all elliptic curves defined over $K$ with $j$-invariant $j$ and good reduction outside $S$.  The method is in the paper below and should be easily doable.

==== Subproject 3 ====

Given an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a number field $K$ and a set or $r$ independent points $P_1,\dots,P_r$ in $E(K)$, and a set $S$ of primes, find all $S$-integral points in the subgroup generated by the points.  [Note that if these points are a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis for $E(K)$, then we will have all $S$-integral points in $E(K)$, but this function will not depend on whether the points are a basis.]

One special case of this should be much easier, since I already have an implementation in Magma: the case $S=\emptyset$.  Magma code (by  by student Thotsaphon Thongjunthug) here: [[attachment:intptsanf.m]]

== Project 3 ==

(Project suggested by William Stein)

Make a table of $p$-adic regulators for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and
$p\leq 100$ (say), for all of Cremona's tables.  These should be
added to his tables.  Precision should just be some arbitrary
choice that makes the computation doable.

Sage can efficiently compute these $p$-adic regulators, due to work of
David Harvey.


== Project 4 ==

Implement the method of Elkies and Watkins (reference below) to find elliptic curves with large numbers of integral points, with a view to finding curves with relatively large rank and small conductor, hoping to break some of the existing records.   This project is likely to suit someone with excellent computing skills (efficiency is the key), and requires less background knowledge than some of the others.   Reference 1 explains the method very clearly, and it should be possible to (re)implement it.    The work described in reference 2 was based on Mestre's "Methode des graphes" which is a way of finding all elliptic curves of given prime conductor.
