== Description ==

The celebrated Gross-Zagier theorem implies that if $E/\mathbf{Q}$ is
an elliptic curve of analytic rank one, then $E(\mathbf{Q})$ contains a
subgroup of finite index generated by a single Heegner point $P_K$
which is necessarily non-torsion.   (Here $K$ is an appropriate
imaginary quadratic field.)  But if $E$ has higher analytic rank,
meaning that presumably $E$ has lots of nontorsion rational points,
then $P_K$ is torsion.  Nonetheless, there is a remarkable theory of
Kolyvagin systems which plays the role of $P_K$.  This is a family of
cohomology classes $\tau_n$ in $H^1(K,E[p])$, indexed by suitable
square-free integers $n$, which satisfy a highly restrictive
compatibility relationship.   If just one member of the family is
nonzero, then there are strong consequences;  for instance, the entire
$p$-Selmer group (which contains $E(K)/pE(K)$ as a subgroup) will be
generated by the Kolyvagin classes $\tau_n$ for $n$ a product of $r-1$
distinct primes, where $r$ is the rank of the $p$-Selmer group for
$E/K$.


Our group will be concerned with the computation of the classes
$\tau_n$.   By the end of the workshop, I would like to see a table of
mod 3 classes $\tau_{\ell_1 \ell_2}$ for the elliptic curve 5077A of
rank 3, for different values of the quadratic field $K$ and for
various pairs of primes $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$.

== Project 1 ==

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve of rank 2, let $p$ be a prime, let $K/\mathbf{Q}$
be an imaginary quadratic field satisfying the Heegner hypothesis.  Finally, let $\ell$ be a 
Kolyvagin prime relative to the data $E$, $K$, $p$.  The Kolyvagin class $\tau_\ell$ lies in a modified Selmer group
$H^1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])$.  (For definitions, see Howard's paper, Def. 1.2.2.)  

(a) Assume that $III_p(E/K)=0$.  Give an algorithm that finds the dimension of $H^1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])$.

(b) If $H^1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])$ is one-dimensional, then it must be a subspace of 
$H^1_{\mathcal{F}}(K,E[p])=E(\mathbf{Q})\otimes\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$. (Howard's paper, Lemma 1.5.3)  Therefore
$\tau_\ell$ lives in a line inside of $E(\mathbf{Q})\otimes\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$.  Which one is it?  

(c) Compare the $\tau_\ell$ from (b) (known only up to torsion) with those produced by William's function "kolyvagin_point_on_curve".

UPDATE:  (a)-(b) has been done for the elliptic curve 389a, for discriminants up to and excluding -67, and for $\ell$ up to $3000$. Here is the Sage code: http://standalone.sagenb.org/home/pub/9/.  Part (c) has been partially checked.

== Project 2 ==

Suppose the Heegner point $y_1\in E(K[1])$ has been computed, so that its coordinates are known as algebraic numbers.  Compute the trace $y_K$ of $y_1$.

== Project 3 ==

The Mordell-Weil group mod $p$ is a subgroup of the mod $p$ Selmer group.  The Kolyvagin classes lie in modified Selmer groups $H^1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])$.  For small values of $p$ (i.e. $p=2$!), directly compute these Selmer groups.  Use the existing Selmer group functionality in SAGE (for number fields).
