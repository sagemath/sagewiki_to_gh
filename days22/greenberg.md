Attached are some text files giving some data about the minimal conductor < 10,000 for an elliptic curve
realizing a mod 2, 3, or 5 representation attached to a newform of level < 150. -Sam

B. $S_4$-extensions: find the curves

People: Brandon Levin, Mike Lipnowski, Gagan Sekhon, Noam Elkies, Jon Cass, David Ai

C. Mod-7 galreps from abvars of prime level not arising from elliptic curves

People: Laura Peskin, M. Tip, Arijit, Rebecca, Mike D, Noam

Level 29 gives an example.    Using the Hasse bound we see that
a2  is -2,-1,0,1,2, so a2  mod 7  is 0,1,2,5,6.    Thus one of the level 29 forms doesn't come from an elliptic curve.

D. Prime powers for small primes

People: Ben Linowitz, Sam Lichtenstein, Gagan, Chris Wuthrich, Barinder, Hatice

Gagan reports that the Galois representations associated to 121A and 121C are surjective mod 2 but not mod 4.

List of Elliptic curves which for which $\rho_E,2$ is surjective mod 2 but not mod 4. 
List of Elliptic curves which for which $\rho_E,2$ is surjective mod 4 but not mod 8.
There is only one conjugacy class of subgroups of GL(2,Z/9) which surjects onto (Z/9Z)* under the determinant map and reduces onto GL(2,Z/3).  It is of size 144=3*#GL(2,Z/3).  So Elkies' analysis of "3 not 9" pins down the image of Galois completely.
