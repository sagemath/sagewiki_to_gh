# Sage Days 22: T-Shirts

The Sage Days 22 workshop t-shirts will be forest green with white lettering. The shirts will be 100% cotton. The design will feature sage code to plot 389a and the corresponding plot on the front. The back will feature the cohomology diagrams from Cremona's 4th lecture on computing all elliptic curves of everywhere good reduction outside a finite set of primes.
