= Sage Days 22: T-Shirts =

We will be creating conference T-shirts for Sage Days 22. The design will have to be settled quickly if we use a local vendor to have shirts by the end of the workshop.

== Color ==

Most of the people who have spoken out are interested in a dark color. A group of students at lunch suggested dark red with yellow lettering.

== Front ==

The front should definitely include the title of the workshop. Additional suggestions are as follows.

    * [[http://math.purdue.edu/~jweigand/PimpMySage.pdf|Pimp My Sage]] -- This idea did not go over well. Perhaps this is too much of an inside joke to the people who like it. Feel free to create these shirts at cafepress if you really want to.
    * Stein's Heegner Point Pictures for 389a
    * The elliptic curve over QQ(sqrt(929)) with everywhere good reduction found by Elkies.
    * Other Suggestions?

== Back ==

    * Cohomology Diagrams (See Cremona's Slides)
    * Elliptic Curves which were born at Sage Days
    * Other Suggestions?
