== Elliptic Curves ==

The elliptic curves REU will consist of projects involving elliptic curves, modular forms, and databases, and make extensive use of [[http://sagemath.org|Sage]]. It will be organized by William Stein, and the number theory postdoc Jon Bober and grad students Alyson Deines and Simon Spicer will also likely help out.  There will be about 6 students. 

=== Pre-REU Reading List ===

   * Wiles's article on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture which can be found [[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_Conjecture/|on the Clay Mathematics Institute website]]
   * Tate's [[attachment:Tate-The_Arithmetic_of_Elliptic_Curves.pdf|beautiful 1974 article on elliptic curves]]
   * Stein's [[http://wstein.org/books/modform/|book (mainly Chapter 1)]]
   * Cremona's [[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/book/fulltext/|book (mainly Chapters 1 and 3)]]
   * Dembele-Voight: [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5727|Explicit methods for Hilbert modular forms]]
   * Open Source Software: the [[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/|Sage]], [[http://docs.python.org/tutorial/|Python]], and [[http://docs.cython.org/index.html|Cython]] tutorials.
   * Silverman's book [[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Z90CA_EUCCkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=silverman+arithmetic+of+elliptic+curves&source=bl&ots=3L0giqRd_4&sig=lDT89Z1h7q1wQy8mgtuQ59xJWfE&hl=en&ei=DjG-TeraIciv8gPH_oXYBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves]] is very generally relevant.

=== Topics may include ===

   * Computing tables of elliptic curves over the field $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{5})$, e.g., as described [[http://wstein.org/talks/2011-02-11-sqrt5/|in this talk]], along with extensive data related to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture about each curve.  This will involve both theoretical work and coding projects. 

   * Computing additional data about elliptic curves over $\mathbf{Q}$, thus extending the data in http://db.modform.org/

   * Computing tables of modular forms (see [[http://wstein.org/books/modform/|my book]]). 

   * Helping John Cremona to extend his [[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/ftp/data/|highly influential tables]].
