== Elliptic Curves REU ==

One smaller part of the REU will consist of projects involving elliptic curves, modular forms, and databases. It will be organized by William Stein (and the number theory postdoc Jon Bober and grad student Alyson Deines will also likely help out).  There will be about 5-6 students.  This summer project isn't funded by the normal REU program, so graduating seniors are eligible.  Topics may include:

   * Computing tables of elliptic curves over the field $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{5})$, e.g., as described [[http://wstein.org/talks/2011-02-11-sqrt5/|in this talk]], along with extensive data related to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture about each curve.  This will involve both theoretical work and coding projects. 

   * Computing additional data about elliptic curves over $\mathbf{Q}$, thus extending the data in http://db.modform.org/

   * Computing tables of modular forms (see [[http://wstein.org/books/modform/|my book]]). 

   * Helping John Cremona to extend his [[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/ftp/data/|highly influential tables]].
