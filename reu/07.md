=== Projects ===
 1. Update Nick's Genus Code.
  * Emily Kirkman, Robert Miller
    * The current version is implemented in SAGE 2.7.1 (available at https://sage.math.washington.edu:8600 )
    * Backtracking should lead to a significant improvement.  (This will probably be hacked at after the REU is over, but you guys should check back because it will be awesome).
 1. Algorithm to test for recoverability
  * Emily Kirkman
  * Circular Planarity Testing: 
    * Status: Linear time achievable by modifying the graph before calling an O(n) planar embedding (testing) algorithm.  (Not reinventing the wheel, just sticking one in the graph).  Currently working on including the Boost library in SAGE.
    * Resources: 
      * A simple O(n) Planarity Testing [[http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~wendym/my_pubs/boyer.ps|Algorithm]]
      * [[http://boost.sourceforge.net/|Boost]] implementation of the algorithm.
  * Criticality
 1. Enhancing precision with exact linear algebra
  * Tom Boothby, Emily Kirkman
 1. Combinatorics of Coxeter Groups (with Sara Billey)
  * Sean Howe, Emily Kirkman, Robert Miller
  * [[reu07/bruhat_notes]]
 1. Dirichlet Problem for Directed Networks
  * Kari Christianson, Lindsay Erickson
 1. Complexers
  * Lindsay Erickson
 1. Graphs and Connections on a Surface of Arbitrary Genus
  * Joe Mitchell
 1. Angle Systems and Embeddings
  * Joey Greer
 1. New Algorithm for Finding Planar Embeddings with user-defined Topological Constraints
  * Emily Kirkman - This will also come after inclusion of Boost.  (see above)
 1. [[Leon|Update]] Jeffrey Leon's Partition Backtracking code
  * Tom Boothby, Robert Miller

== Wiki examples ==
To include a link:

{{{
[http://www.math.washington.edu/~morrow/reu07/reu.html Jim Morrow's page]
[:Leon: update]
}}}
To add a table of contents:

{{{
[[TableOfContents]]
}}}
To format the table of contents (simultaneously formatting the page):

{{{
== Top Level, No. 1 ==
== Top Level, No. 2 ==
=== Next Level, No. 1 ===
=== Next Level, No. 2 ===
==== Another Level, etc. ====
== Top Level, No. 3 ==
}}}
To create a new wiki page, simply navigate there, and you will be given a new blank page.

MoinMoin, this particular brand of wiki, also allows you to use LaTeX:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n{n \choose k}x^k$$

$\sum_{k=1}^n{n \choose k}x^k$

$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & \omega \\0 & 0 & -\omega & 0\end{array}\right]$$

Here's how to do that:

{{{
$$\sum_{k=1}^n{n \choose k}x^k$$
$\sum_{k=1}^n{n \choose k}x^k$
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & \omega \\0 & 0 & -\omega & 0\end{array}\right]$$
}}}
NOTE: The double-dollar notation is a replacement for LaTeX's math environment \[...\], which does not work in the wiki.
