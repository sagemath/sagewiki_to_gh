== Tuesday, June 21 ==

  * 10am-12pm: Introduction to Sage in Communications B27.   [[http://tinyurl.com/3j83k48|Video]]
  * Presentation of assignments from June 20 (table up to norm conductor 124):
        * Rado Kirov: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/47/
        * Ben Leveque: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/50/
        * Andrew Ohana: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/51/
        * Ashwath Rabindranath: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/53/
        * Paul Sharaba: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/56/
        * William Stein: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/46/
  * Demos of things you've done using Sage (e.g., interacts, etc.):
        * Ben Leveque's Farey Graph: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/52/
  * Get started with the Wiki a little: http://wiki.sagemath.org/reu/2011
  * Andrew Ohana and Aly Deines: canonical stuff [[attachment:ohana1.pdf]]
  * Mentioned: dumps, loads, save, load
  * nosqlite: http://code.google.com/p/nosqlite/ along with [[http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/55/|a worksheet that illustrates it]].
  * Antwerp IV -- old tables of elliptic curves: http://modular.math.washington.edu/Tables/antwerp/
  * Read [[http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1995-32-04/S0273-0979-1995-00616-6/S0273-0979-1995-00616-6.pdf|Ribet's awesome paper 'Galois representations and modular forms']], in particular Sections 3 and 5.
  * Extensive data over Q(sqrt(5)) so far is [[http://wstein.org/Tables/hmf/sqrt5/|here as plain text files]].  This can be used instead of http://db.modform.org, and is easier to parse.

== Wednesday, June 22 ==
  * Rado's talk at 10am in Communications B27:   
           * Demo: http://sagenb.org/javascript/graph_editor2/index.html
           * Best HTML5 canvas tutorial:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/canvas_tutorial
           * Graph editor source code: https://bitbucket.org/radokirov/js-graph-editor
  * 11:30am -- meet in the Sage lab
  * Aly Deines -- Global minimal models at 3:10pm. http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/62/
  * Get started with Mercurial a little: http://code.google.com/p/uw-nt-reu2011/
  * William's idea for determining whether there is a p-isogeny: http://nt.sagenb.org/home/pub/61/
  * Elkies tables that have isogeny examples: http://www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/nature.html
  * William: Added [[http://code.google.com/p/uw-nt-reu2011/source/detail?r=c13b6e9fa71d1bdeadee1ceb2c738aa0cebf6456|initial template version of our goal paper]] to the repository. 
  * Here is an initial table that adds |T|, signs, ord(disc), ord_(j), Tamagawa numbers, and Kodaira symbols: [[attachment:InitialCurveData.txt]]
