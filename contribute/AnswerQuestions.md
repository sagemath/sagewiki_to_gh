_**Contribute to SageMath by answering questions**_ 

You have some expertise with <a class="http" href="http://sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>. 

One way to contribute is to answer other people's questions. 

This page lists questions-and-answers ("Q&A") sites or mailing lists where such questions are frequently asked, and some usage tips. 

[[_TOC_]] 


# Ask Sage

<a href="http://ask.sagemath.org/">http://ask.sagemath.org/</a> 

Our official Q&A site, powered by Askbot (an open-source engine for Q&A sites, running on top of the Python-based Django web framework). 

Very well indexed by search engines.

# sage-support

<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-support">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-support</a> 

A support mailing list, powered by Google Groups. 

Less visible in web search engines than Ask Sage. 


# Stackoverflow and Stack Exchange

Stackoverflow / Stack Exchange is a popular network of Q&A sites. 

You can create an account on these sites using an email address and a password, or you can log in using Google, Facebook, etc. 

Several of these sites see SageMath-related questions with some frequency. 

Most will have a [sage] or [sagetex] "tag" or keyword. 

(Sometimes the [sage] tag is shared with other things called Sage.) 

* <a class="http" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>: <a class="http" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sage">questions tagged sage</a> 
* <a class="http" href="http://superuser.com/">SuperUser</a>: <a class="http" href="http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/sage">questions tagged sage</a> 
* <a class="http" href="http://math.stackexchange.com/">Mathematics.SE</a>: <a class="http" href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sage">questions tagged sage</a> 
* <a class="http" href="http://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a>: <a class="http" href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/sage">questions tagged sage</a> 
* <a class="http" href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX.SE</a>: <a class="http" href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sagetex">questions tagged sagetex</a> 
The search box allows you to search for tags and keywords. 

For example you could search `[sage] polynomial` to search questions or answers tagged `[sage]` and containing the word `polynomial`. 

Once logged in, if you hover your mouse over the [sage] tag, a description pops up in which you can click the "star", which will subscribe you to email alerts about this tag.
