== Funding ==

Participants from the test sites for the NSF UTMOST project will have first priority for funding, though we do expect to have some funds to support travel for those with a demonstrated interest in using Sage in educational settings.  We also expect to have a similar workshop in Summer 2012 which will have twice the available funding.  Please contact Rob Beezer at beezer@ups.edu to request funding.
