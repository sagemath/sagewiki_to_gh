= Mailing Lists =

 * Mailing list for [[http://groups.google.com/group/sagedays31|Sage Days 31]], which will be used for Education Days also.  Please add yourself to this list if you are not already on it.  This will be the primary vehicle for announcements, and last-minute changes during the week.

 * There is also a list specifically for discussing [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu|education and Sage]].

= Organizers =

 * Rob Beezer [[http://buzzard.ups.edu]]
 * William Stein [[http://wstein.org/]]

= Funding =

Participants from the test sites for the NSF UTMOST project will have first priority for funding, though we will support travel for a few participants with a demonstrated interest and experience in using Sage in educational settings.  We also expect to have a similar workshop in Summer 2012 which will have twice the available funding.

<<Anchor(registration)>>
= Registration =

Sign up by adding your name to the "Participants" list above.  Email Rob Beezer  at beezer@ups.edu if you'd rather not figure out how to edit the wiki page and he'll add your name.  (Hint: there are 168 primes less than 1000.)

= Logistics =

 * June 16, 17 and 18 are expected to be full days.  So plan to travel on June 15 and June 19.
 * [[days31|Sage Days 31]] will happen the same week at the University of Washington with the Sage Notebook as its theme.
 * Sessions will be held in [[http://www.washington.edu/maps/?l=SAV|Savery Hall]] on the historic Quad, just northeast of Red Square.  Specifically, [[http://www.css.washington.edu/room/SAV+131|Savery 131]].
 * Lodging will be arranged for funded participants at the Collegiana Inn near the UW campus.  For other lodging options see the local information page.
 * See the [[uw-local-info|local information page]] for more specifics.

= Projects =

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be:

 * Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course.
 * Preparing worksheets for a course.
 * Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library.
 * Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.
