= Funding =

Participants from the test sites for the NSF UTMOST project will have first priority for funding, though we do expect to have some funds to support travel for those with a demonstrated interest in using Sage in educational settings.  We also expect to have a similar workshop in Summer 2012 which will have twice the available funding.  Please contact Rob Beezer at beezer@ups.edu to request funding.

<<Anchor(registration)>>
= Registration =

Sign up by adding your name to the "Participants" list above.  Email Rob Beezer  at beezer@ups.edu if you'd rather not figure out how to edit the wiki page and he'll add your name.  (Hint: there are 168 primes less than 1000.)

= Logistics =

 * June 16, 17 and 18 are expected to be full days.  So plan to travel on June 15 and June 19.
 * [[days31|Sage Days 31]] will happen the same week at the University of Washington with the Sage Notebook as its theme.
 * Lodging will likely be arranged for participants at the Collegiana Inn near the UW campus.  Details later.
 * See the [[uw-local-info|local information page]] for more specifics.

= Projects =

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be:

 * Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course.
 * Preparing worksheets for a course.
 * Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library.
 * Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.
