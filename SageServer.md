= Setting up a Sage server =
by Jason Grout


I recently set up a Sage server, and here are very rough notes of what I did.  Please email the [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|sage-support]] email list if you have any questions.  Please feel free to make these notes better.



== Why set up a server? ==

I used [[http://www.sagenb.org]] for a semester.  I then set up a campus server and used that for a semester.  Here are the advantages to having a campus server that I found (in no particular order): 

  1. At various times, we would experience slowdowns in {{{sagenb.org}}} (it always seemed to happen during a class presentation!).  We attributed this to our internet connection, the server being overloaded, or both.  A dedicated campus server takes care of both of these issues (provided you budget enough hardware).
  2. I am not comfortable with asking students to publish worksheets on the public server.  There are some people that would not be comfortable with having the students do any work on an external server.  A campus server can be firewalled to only be accessible from on campus.
  3. While the {{{sagenb.org}}} administrators do a fantastic job, there are no guarantees about service, uptime, backups, etc.  Having a campus server allows us to control these things (especially backups!).  
  4. We had no control over when upgrades were performed.  It was possible that a feature of Sage that we were using would change in a next release.  If so, having a campus server allows me to fix a version for the semester and stick with it (or just do upgrades if it won't negatively affect the students' experience), so that the experience is consistent for the semester.  On the other hand, there were several features that I contributed to Sage to help the students, and I could apply those immediately on a campus server, instead of having to wait until the next version of Sage.

In our case, we found an old server that was several years old sitting unused.  We put 16GB of RAM in it to handle the load we would like to handle and that was our only cost.


== Hardware Requirements ==

=== RAM ===

The biggest bottleneck seems to be RAM; that will determine how many simultaneous users you can have.  Some anecdotal evidence indicates that, with the 'new' notebook in Sage 5.2 or later, classes of 60-70 take around 12-14GB of RAM (assuming most students have several worksheets open simultaneously).  The key to calculating RAM usage is to estimate the number of worksheets open simultaneously, and get an estimate of the sorts of computations people are running.  For example, doing integration starts up maxima, which takes a lot of memory.


== Install the server ==

I started with a fresh copy of Ubuntu 10.04, with a working Sage compiled from source (which means I had to install some extra packages so that Sage compiles and runs; see the Sage README.  In particular, I needed to install ).

  0) I install libssl-dev so that Sage can load https urls
{{{
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
}}}

Also, I had to install the following so that Sage would build (see the README.txt file that comes with Sage):

{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install gfortran
}}}

I installed these packages to provide extra capabilities in Sage:

{{{
sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat # could also install imagemagick instead
sudo apt-get install libpango1.0-dev libcairo-dev # to pick up dependencies for R to enable png support
sudo apt-get install texlive-full # could probably install a subset of texlive instead
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev # for qepcad
}}}

(I think the R png capabilities line is right.  If it's not, you may have to also install the xorg-dev, libpng-dev, and/or r-base packages)

I installed this to help me manage the server better:

{{{
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades # edit unattended upgrades config; see https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/automatic-updates.html
sudo apt-get install mercurial
}}}

  1) Install haproxy (see older versions of this webpage which use apache instead of haproxy)
{{{
sudo apt-get install haproxy
}}}

  2) Create a config for the Sage server.  I edit the {{{/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg}}} to have the following contents
{{{
# this config needs haproxy-1.1.28 or haproxy-1.2.1

global
	log 127.0.0.1	local0
	log 127.0.0.1	local1 notice
	#log loghost	local0 info
	maxconn 4096
	#chroot /usr/share/haproxy
	user haproxy
	group haproxy
	daemon
	#debug
	#quiet

defaults
	log	global
	mode	http
	option	httplog
	option	dontlognull
	retries	3
	option redispatch
	maxconn	2000
	contimeout	5000
	clitimeout	50000
	srvtimeout	50000

listen	sageserver 0.0.0.0:80
	server	sageserver localhost:8000 check 
}}}


  3) Enable haproxy by changing the {{{ENABLED}}} line to {{{ENABLED=1}}} in {{{/etc/default/haproxy}}} and then run haproxy by doing 
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/haproxy start
}}}

  4) Now add a server and 10 user accounts.  The Sage notebook will invoke one of these 10 accounts to do the worksheet processing.
{{{
sudo addgroup sageuser
sudo adduser --disabled-password sageserver
for i in $(seq 0 9); do
 sudo adduser --disabled-password --ingroup sageuser sage$i
done
}}}

  5) I wanted to restrict logins for the sage server and sage users.  I want to prevent logins as sageserver, and restrict sage* logins to only come from localhost.  I'll use sudo to run commands as the sage server.  Under {{{/etc/pam.d/sshd}}}, uncomment this line, and add "nodefgroup":

{{{
account  required     pam_access.so nodefgroup
}}}

  Then in {{{/etc/security/access.conf}}}, add these lines (`<backup>` is the IP address of the backup server):

{{{
-:(sageuser):ALL EXCEPT localhost
-:sageserver:ALL EXCEPT <backup>
}}}


  6) Now set up passwordless ssh keys.  I don't thing the following sudo syntax works anymore.  I had to do this by hand now.
{{{
sudo -u sageserver -i ssh-keygen -t dsa
for i in $(seq 0 9); do
 sudo cat ~sageserver/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | sudo -u sage$i -i "umask 077; test -d .ssh || mkdir .ssh ; cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys "
done
}}}

  7) Test logins (do at least one to generate the known_hosts file)
{{{
sudo -u sageserver ssh sage0@localhost echo Done
}}}


  8) I store the following command in a file {{{/home/sageserver/startnotebook}}} to start the notebook
{{{
 #!/bin/sh

~/sage/sage -c "notebook(interface='localhost', directory='./sage_notebook.sagenb',port=8000, accounts=True, timeout=3600, server_pool=['sage%d@localhost'%i for i in range(10)], ulimit='-u 100 -t 36000 -v 500000', open_viewer=False)" 
}}}

Note that I explicitly set the notebook directory, so that the directory doesn't default to live inside of {{{~/.sage}}}.  This is so that the normal procedure of making {{{~/.sage}}} not publicly accessible doesn't also cut off access to each cell's DATA directory.


  9) Now copy the current version of Sage into the sageserver home directory.  I set up things so that {{{/home/sageserver/sage/}}} is a symbolic link to whatever the current version is (like {{{/home/sageserver/sage-4.3.2/}}}):

{{{
   cd ~sageserver
   ln -s sage-4.3.2 sage
}}}

  10) Install any optional spkgs that you want.  I install these:

{{{
for i in 'biopython' 'cbc' 'glpk' 'graphviz' 'pyx' 'dot2tex' 'fricas'; do
    sudo -u sageserver ~sageserver/sage/sage -i $i;
done;
}}}

To start the sage server, do the following.  Note that since I am using sudo to run commands as sageserver, instead of logging in as sageserver, I have to do the {{{script /dev/null}}} trick to get screen to work.

{{{
sudo su -l sageserver
script /dev/null
screen ./startnotebook
}}}

I also added this to ~/sage/sage to control process limits:

{{{
if [[ `whoami` = sage* ]]; then
   echo "User " `whoami`
   ulimit -v 1500000 -u 300 -n 128 -t 1800
fi
}}}

== Additional Notes ==

 * To enable the jmol static image rendering, you need to install java as well.  I do:
{{{
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
}}}

 * At some point, it's good to {{{chattr +i}}} the sage0-9 account home directories, .ssh directories, etc., to prevent changes.  On OS X, use chflags.
 * Enable acl permissions by editing fstab and adding the "acl" option behind the ext4 option (make sure your filesystem allows acls, of course).  Then you can better protect files from being seen by sage worksheet processes.
 * [[https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/automatic-updates.html]] also has some helpful tips.
 * Jason Ekstrand from Iowa State University notes that if you want to enable SSL, you can do this at the command line: {{{
sudo apt-get install ssl-cert
sudo make-ssl-cert
}}} and then use this for your {{{/etc/apache2/sites-available/sagenotebook}}} {{{

== Alternative port forwarding arrangements ==

Apart from Apache, it may also be possible to use `iptables` or some other NAT firewall to do the port forwarding. In that case you should of course run the sage notebook with `secure=True`, because a firewall will not be providing an SSL layer for you. The command to forward, for instance, port 443 to port 8000 on network interface `eth0` (you should check if that is the interface on which the connections come in)  is
{{{
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8000
}}}
You should check with your own system to see how to make such a rule permanent. If you want check which `nat` rules are in effect type
{{{
iptables -t nat -L
}}}
