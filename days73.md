= Sage Days 73 in Oaxaca, Mexico May 04-07 2016 =

[[http://sagemath.org|Sage]] is an open source software for mathematics. This is the webpage for the Sage workshop prior to the conference [[http://www.birs.ca/events/2016/5-day-workshops/16w5010|Flat Surfaces and Dynamics of Moduli Space]] to be held in Oaxaca May 08-13. The aim is to:

 * introduce Sage to people from Oaxaca or assisting to the conference

 * have program and code presentations about geometry and dynamics of surfaces

 * help people to implement their own projects

It is intended to be a small workshop (10 to 15 people) focusing on coding sprints.

== Talks ==

 * (tutorial / presentation) Pat Hooper: [[https://github.com/videlec/sage-flatsurf|Flatsurf]]

 * (tutorial / presentation) Vincent Delecroix: [[http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/flatsurf.html|the flatsurf package]] (warning: distinct from the above!)

 * ? (tutorial) number types in Sage: integers, rationals, number fields, symbolic, floating point, intervals, balls

 * ? (tutorial) SL2Z and triangle group code in Sage

 * ? (tutorial) graphs and digraphs in Sage ([[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/index.html|Sage graph stuff]] and possibly [[http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/bliss/|bliss software]], [[http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/|nauty and Traces]], [[http://igraph.org/redirect.html|igraph]], ...)

== Projects ==

 * infinite index subgroups of SL2Z

 * arbitrary subgroups of SL2R, SL2C

 * construct SL2Z subgroups (SL2R?, SL2C?) from a set of generators

 * Lyapunov exponents, volume, Siegel Veech constants

 * Delaunay triangulations

 * ... ''add your own project'' ...

== Existing programs about translation surfaces ==

 * Alex Eskin code (saddle connection exploration + decomposition in cylinders)

 * various [[http://math.rice.edu/~rm51/|programs by Ronen Mukamel]] (Delaunay triangulations, Teichmueller curves especially in genus 2)

 * Vincent Delecroix [[http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/flatsurf.html|flatsurf package]] (mostly interval exchanges and square tiled surfaces, but a bit of topology)

 * Vincent Delecroix and Pat Hooper [[https://github.com/videlec/sage-flatsurf|drawing program]]

 * Charles Fougeron code for Lyapunov exponents of strata coverings (see [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16102|trac ticket #16102]])

 * Chris Swierczewski [[https://github.com/abelfunctions/abelfunctions|Riemann surfaces package]]
