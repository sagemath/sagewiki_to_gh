Hello, I study math at the University of Dortmund. Most of the time I spend with SAGE is dedicated to making it work better on Windows using cygwin.

== Task Table ==
=== Currently Working on ===
 * DMG installation image for MacOSX
 * MSI Windows installer
 * Cygwin port of SAGE, build tests and small compilation fixes
=== Short Term ===
 * multivariate polynomial arithmetic via CoCoALib
 * computation of approximate vanishing ideals via ApCoCoALib (needs multivariate polynomial arithmetic via CoCoALib)
 * check targets for various SAGE packages like gmp and linbox
 * make all packages using BLAS/Lapack use the Accelerate Framework on MacOSX. Patch for Linbox exists and will hopefully show up in Linbox svn soon
=== Long Term ===
 * F4/F5 in CoCoALib with interface to  SAGE
=== Interesting Ideas ===
 * port SAGE code to MinGW/MSVC - probably done when hell freezes over - but one can at least dream.
 * fix pari issue on cygwin - details FIXME
== Done Tasks ==
 * FIXME

= Other Software Interests =
 * Windows gmp port
 * Linbox with MSVC

 * google group sage-devel
 * google group linbox-devel
 * google group linbox-use
