Hello, I study math at the University of Dortmund. Most of the time I spend with SAGE is dedicated around packages and their portability. I added valgrind support to Sage 2.8.3 and have been using various valgrind tools to investigate Sage's memory consumption.

I am the main release manager for Sage and I chaired a number of releases - 29 so far: 

 * 2.8.11, 2.8.13-2.8.15
 * 2.9, 2.9.2-3
 * 2.10, 2.10.1-3, 2.10.4 (together with Robert Miller)
 * 2.11
 * 3.0, 3.0.1-6
 * 3.1, 3.1.1-4
 * 3.2, 3.2.1-3 

== Task Table ==

=== Currently Working on ===
 * Probably chairing the current Sage release
 * [[solaris|Solaris port of Sage]]
 * [[freebsd|FreeBSD port of Sage]]
 * [[windows|MSVC port of Sage]]
 * [[windows|Cygwin re-port of Sage]]
 * [[osx64|64 bit OSX port of Sage]]
 * hunt mem-leaks in C/C++ code of Sage
 * [[DebianSAGE]]
 * whatever else currently needs fixing
 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&owner=mabshoff&order=priority|My open trac tickets]] (the idea was shamelessly stolen from Martin Albrecht)

== Done Tasks ==
 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/query?status=closed&owner=mabshoff&order=priority|My closed trac tickets]] (the idea was shamelessly stolen from Martin Albrecht)
 * See the Changelog, the google groups sage-devel and sage-support and #sage-devel on freenode.
 * DMG installation image for MacOSX [other people did most of the work here]
 * make all packages using BLAS/Lapack use the Accelerate Framework on MacOSX. Patch for Linbox exists and will hopefully show up in Linbox svn soon
= Other Software Interests =
 * Linbox with MSVC
 * Porting mathematical open source code to Solaris, Windows and any odd Unix out there.
= Places where I can be found =
 * google groups sage-devel, sage-support, linbox-devel, group linbox-use
 * [[http://apcocoa.org/forum/|the ApCoCoA & CoCoA forum]]
 * #sage-devel on freenode
