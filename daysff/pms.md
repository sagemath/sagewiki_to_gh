Goal--get the examples from the Thesis to work

Pointsearch *height zero or one, easy, since we just need a point, we can possibly just do this ourselves
            *eventually need the whole thing, since points might have larger hight
            *in the examples they are all hight zero or one

ConcisFF(Kevin) *square roots in residue fields and lifts, also conic solving over QQ (auxiliary,i.e. useful in general)

DescentFF(all-ish) *in the process of being decomposed and doctested/tested
                   *need to find intersections of curves (points) -restrict to hight zero or one?
                   *find all the singular points? make this case work?

LocSol(Aly) *needs testing and debugging

Independant *needs is_linear_independent method on elliptic curves (mwrank from number field to function field--ask Cremona?)
            *this is dependent on heights

PointSearchFF *immediate goal is height zero and one cases

QuartMin(Gerriet) *finished but not tested

Other *decide classes, i.e. where these go and how to get them into trac

Typos in Examples *compile and fix these
