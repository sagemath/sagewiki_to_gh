 * GOAL: SAGE Enhancement Proposal.

   * Unified database structure for SAGE.

     * Database class: init establishes connection to sqlite

 * Issues to brainstorm:

   * SAGE [http://www.initd.org/pub/software/pysqlite/doc/usage-guide.html interface] to sqlite

   * Uniform database approach within sage

   * Databases distributed with sage

   * Online databases
 
     * cgi web-accessible...

     * accessible from SAGE, perhaps hosted at sage.math...

     * SQLite servers?

   * Automagic caching: keep track of computation results

     * keeping those results in portable objects, making these objects merge-able, etc...

   * Licensing: $\exists$ DBGPL?
