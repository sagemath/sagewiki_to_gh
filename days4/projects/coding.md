 * '''Leon's partition backtracking''' programs are almost ready for inclusion as a SAGE spkg. I'd like to have each of Leon's original command-line functions wrapped in the library I'm working on. A native group theory class will be much more feasible if these programs are all available.  

 * Once Leon's library is finished, the DSage '''Doubly Even Codes''' class will not depend on magma at all, and will be suitable for inclusion to the SAGE library.

 * David Joyner: I'm also interested in coding theory and in particular Robert Miller's work on (now GPL'd) '''Leon's partition backtracking''' programs.
