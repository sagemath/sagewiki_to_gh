[:days4/projects/: Other SAGE Days 4 Project]

Participants: Kirsten Fagnan, Josh Kantor, didier deshommes

Possible Projects depending on interests of participants
  
  *  Extend numerical sparse matrix capabilities (additional constructors for special forms such as tridiagonal)
  *  Implement numerical complex sparse matrices based on Josh's real sparse matrices.
  *  Incorporate clapack into SAGE 
  *  Possibly try to include ARPACK (depends on clapack)
  *  Improve SAGE's support for octave and matlab
