 * Nick Alexander (from UCI) and Thea (from SFU): I'd like to implement some basic''' linear algebra over Z/nZ''', following perhaps  '' Algorithms for Linear Algebra Problems over Principal Ideal Rings '' (1996), Johannes Buchmann, Stefan Neis at http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/719844.html.   The algorithms of that paper apply to principal ideal '''rings''', and in the case of a principal ideal '''domain''', reduce to computing the Hermite normal form.  So this could expand to trying to compute the Hermite normal form in the manner of Steel's unpublished algorithm as implemented in MAGMA.
