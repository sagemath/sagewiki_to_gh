 * Revise the guided tour part of the '''SAGE tutorial''' to much better reflect the symbolic calculus functionality, its pros, cons, etc.
 * W Stein: '''Documentation'''.  Have teams describe how to do the following in tutorial fashion, with all examples automatically doctested:
  * Use SageX to create an interface to a C library (case study -- GMP-ECM).
  * Convert a program from .sage files to .py library code.
  * Convert a .py Python program to SageX for speed.
  * Create publication-quality graphics for inclusion in latex documents.
  * Port code from Magma to SAGE.
  * Make an existing PARI-GP / GAP / Singular / Lisp / Maxima program easily usable from SAGE.
  * (Bobby Moretti): How to create a ring or other structure object in SAGE, what class to inherit from, how to set the parent object, what methods to override in both python and SageX, etc.

 * W Stein: Continue to flesh out ideas for '''JSAGE -- the open source math software journal'''.  I announced JSAGE at SD3, and it's been very interesting to see it start to take off.  It's critical that we actually *write* some code to manage JSAGE, and figure out how to really do it right -- much more work is needed.  In particular, a good way of dealing with code submissions from people that don't know much about SAGE development, but have awesome code and ideas to contribute.
