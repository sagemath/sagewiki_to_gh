== Global Server Settings ==

This is only valid for a user that has admin privileges.

 * Add/revoke admin privileges from other users
 * Add a user to a restriction group

== Individual Worksheet Management ==
 * Add/remove viewers
 * Add/remove collaborators (can these collaborators invite others?)
 * Publish (for now, this means "make the worksheet globally visible in real time")
