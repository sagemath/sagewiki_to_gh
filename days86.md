~-(originally planned May 8-12, 2017)-~

At the occasion of the thematic semester [[http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Combinatorics2017/index.php/|Algebra and words in combinatorics]] from March to July 2017, a [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops|Sage Days]] will be held at [[http://lacim.uqam.ca/en/|Laboratoire de combinatoire et d'informatique mathématique (LaCIM)]] of [[http://www.uqam.ca/|Université du Québec à Montréal]].

**Monday April 17th is a holiday and LaCIM will be closed, and we will
meet somewhere downtown for informal coding sprints (stay tuned). The
official program will therefore start on Tuesday.**

== Target audience ==

 * Newcomers to advanced users that want to learn more about and get training on the open source mathematical system [[http://sagemath.org|SageMath]] and related software.
 * (would be) developers that want to participate to coding sprints.

== Invited speakers ==

 * [[http://bergeron.math.uqam.ca/|François Bergeron]] (LaCIM, Université du Québec à Montréal); topic: experimental mathematics
 * [[http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm|James Mitchell]] (CIRCA, University of St Andrews); topic: [[https://gap-packages.github.io/Semigroups/|GAP's semigroup package]] and the [[https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/libsemigroups/|libsemigroup]] C++ library
 * Thierry Monteil (CNRS, CALIN, Université Paris Nord); topic: TBA
 * [[http://math.bu.edu/people/jbala/|Jennifer S. Balakrishnan]] (Boston University); topic: TBA

== Organizers ==

 * Sébastien Labbé (CNRS, LaBRI, Université de Bordeaux)
 * Nicolas M. Thiéry (Université Paris Sud)

== Where ==

Monday: TBA
Tuesday-Friday: Room PK-4323 of the [[http://carte.uqam.ca/pavillon-pk|Président-Kennedy building]]

== Themes ==

The themes will certainly be influenced by the four main workshops held during the semester:

 * Combinatorics on Words and Tilings (March 27 -- April 7 2017)
 * Bridges between Automatic Sequences, Algebra and Number Theory (April 24 -- May 5 2017) 
 * Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics of Reflection Groups (May 29 -- June 9 2017)
 * Equivariant Combinatorics (June 12-23 2017)
