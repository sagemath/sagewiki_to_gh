== Projects ==

Feel free to add suggestions to our [[/projects|list of projects]]

== Participants ==

See our [[/participants|list of participants]].

== Lodging and Travel ==

If you still need the info on lodging and travel arrangements, [[/travel|look here]].  Check out is Sunday July 23 at 11am, and the front desk's number is 802-656-5550.

== Reimbursements ==

Instructions for reimbursements will be given on the first day of the conference. If you are '''not''' a US citizen or green card holder, please bring your passport and any visa paperwork you have (I-94, visa stamps, etc.) so that we can make scans while you are here.

== Internet on campus ==

The University of Vermont offers [[https://www.eduroam.us/|eduroam]] on campus. To access the network at UVM, please take a few minutes to set up your laptop before traveling, while you are on your home university campus. If you do not have eduroam, please contact Christelle Vincent to receive a guest log in for UVM's network.

== The k8s server ==

William has kindly provided a server for us to use during the workshop, with 48 CPUs and 256 GB of RAM.  It is running !CoCalc, so you can access it from your browser.

=== Creating an Account ===

You should create an account [[https://k8s.sagemath.org/settings|here]].  You will need a secret token, which has been e-mailed to participants (ask someone if you can't find it).  Once you have an account, someone will have to add you to the Sage Days 87 project; anyone who is already part of the project can do so from the project settings page.  At that point, you will be able to access the server at [[https://k8s.sagemath.org|k8s.sagemath.org]].

=== Git ===

If you will be doing Sage development, you need to set up a terminal that knows who you are (since we're all using the same user when we log in from the browser).  This way we will be able to share Sage installations on the server.  To set this up, open up a terminal (`~/Terms/Admin.term` exists for this purpose) and run the script `~/Terms/setup_gitterm.py`.  This will ask you some questions (name, e-mail, trac account info) and create a terminal for you (`~/Terms/$TRAC_USERNAME_git.term`).  It will also create an ssh key specific to you that you should upload to [[https://trac.sagemath.org/prefs/sshkeys|trac]].  If you're ever interacting with git, you should use this terminal (or the ssh method described below).  In particular, please don't set the git configuration on any of the Sage installations.

Note that by default, it will store your trac password in plain text in a file on the server.  If you don't want it to, just answer "No" to the "store trac password" question, and you'll be asked for it at the beginning of each ssh session.

=== SSH ===

Once you add the public key from your laptop (generated by `ssh-keygen` and then copied from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` for example) to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in the browser, you will be able to SSH into the project using the following command.

{{{ssh da1818ed996d4de6acc6361415b7725d@k8s-ssh.sagemath.org -p 2222 -t .roed}}}

where `roed` should be replaced by your trac username (if you haven't run `setup_gitterm.py`, you can just leave off the `-t .roed` altogether).

=== Sage installations ===

You can create a new Sage installation within a couple minutes as follows (replace BLAH with the name of your installation, e.g. your trac username):

{{{
cd ~/Src/
./new_sage BLAH
}}}

Now `sage-BLAH` is available for you to work on a ticket.  If you think you'll be doing a lot of development, feel free to create your own installation (labeled with your trac username); if you're less experienced you might share one as part of a group.

=== Building and Large output ===

Avoid sending huge amounts of output in a terminal, as this slows the whole project down for everybody (proper output truncation isnâ€™t sufficiently implemented).

Instead, please do
{{{
./sage -b > output
}}}
rather than just sending a large amount of output to your terminal.  You can check on output by typing
{{{
tail output
}}}

Alternatively, if you know tmux, do control+b, then c to make a new session, and leave the large-output session in a different session.  You can switch back and forth with control+b then n.


=== Jupyter notebooks ===

[edited by William Stein]

Our custom Sages ARE available from Jupyter notebooks.  Just make a copy of /projects/da1818ed-996d-4de6-acc6-361415b7725d/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/sageroed (next to it) and edit kernel.json to point to your install.   See https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/2201

=== Tmux ===

The current !CoCalc terminal implementation has some bugs with resizing inserting strange control characters.  The fix is to type tmux after you've opened and logged into your personal terminal, or to just use SSH.

== Local dining options ==

Check out the [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A2B4-EmWB1cUQat364SzVJV9aD4&usp=sharing|map]] Christelle made!  Some people will be getting takeout for dinner.

== To prepare for the workshop ==

On the first day of the workshop, [[http://people.reed.edu/~westm/|Mckenzie West]] will lead some activities to help novices get oriented with Sage. Stay tuned for more details. Before the workshop, we recommend [[http://www.sagemath.org/|downloading and installing]] the latest version of the source code of Sage, opening a [[https://trac.sagemath.org/|Sage trac]] account and completing the [[https://www.codecademy.com/|Code Academy]] modules on Python and Git.



If you have never done any LMFDB development work and might want to start -- a workshop is by far the
best place to get started. A starting point is have a recent
installation of Sage on your own laptop, on top of which you can run
the LMFDB website software with a little setting up.
Here is how to do it: https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/blob/master/GettingStarted.md

For this workshop, we have dedicated server for readonly purposes that simplifies some of the steps. If you add to your LMFDB directory a file called {{{mongoclient.config}}} with the following content:
{{{
[db]
port = 27017
host = readonly.lmfdb.xyz 
}}}
 then you can run the LMFDB as usual by doing:
{{{
 sage -python start-lmfdb.py --debug
}}}
