== Lodging ==

We anticipate that most participants will stay in [[https://www.uvm.edu/~arch/?Page=projects/learningcomplex.html&SM=pastprojectsmenu.html|these dorms]], which have air conditioned rooms, private bathrooms and common spaces for work and socializing in the evenings.  They have gotten good reviews from previous conferences, but if you prefer to stay in a hotel and we're funding your lodging, please contact the organizers (we can allocate your lodging amount toward a hotel with enough advance notice).  Similarly, if we're not funding your lodging but you want to stay in the dorms, this may be possible: please contact an organizer as soon as possible.

== Travel ==

'''If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, please book flights on a US carrier.'''  If you are not a US citizen or permanent resident, this restriction does not apply to you (since we're funding you from a different grant).  Note that the [[http://mcofamericas.org/latest-news/mathematical-congress-americas-2017|Mathematical Congress of the Americas]] is the week after Sage Days 87; if you're interested in attending you may want to plan your travel accordingly.

There are two main ways to get to Burlington.

 1. Fly into BTV.
 1. Fly to Montreal (YUL), Manchester (MHT) or Boston (BOS) and take [[https://www.greyhound.com/|Greyhound]] to Burlington.
  * Buses depart from Montreal Berri station at 8:15, 10:45, 16:15 and 23:30 and take about 2:45 to get to Burlington (though this can vary due to US customs).  The city bus (747) from the airport takes 45 minutes to go directly to the Greyhound station and runs every 30 minutes.  Note that the city bus requires a day pass, which costs $10 and can be purchased inside the terminal.
  * Buses depart from Manchester Airport direct to Burlington -- 0:55-4:00, 11:35-15:20 and 15:05-19:55.
  * Buses depart Boston South Station, running 7:00-11:55, 10:30-15:20, 14:00-19:55, 23:20-4:00.  The city bus (Silver line) from the airport takes 15 minutes to go directly to the Greyhound station and runs every 12 minutes.  The silver line from the airport is free.

There may also be carpools traveling from these Boston, Montreal and Hanover, NH.  If you're interested in a carpool feel free to edit this wiki page.

=== Carpool ===

 * Montreal -> Vermont:

    * Marc M.: my flight arrives too late for the afternoon bus. Would be interested in carpooling after 5pm on Sunday (7/16) or early morning on Monday (7/17).
    * JP Flori: Same situation for me (landing from Paris (France) at 3:00pm). I was thinking of taking the 11pm bus, arriving at Burlington (airport... we could share a taxi from there) around 2am. It should be possible to check in at that time according to David. It might be easier to take the monday morning 8:15am bus, arriving at Burlington (transit center, downtown!) before 11am.

 * Vermont -> Montreal:

    * Marc M.: Greyhound tickets appear to be sold out on Saturday (7/22). I'd like to get to Montreal airport before 7pm (I have a flight at 8.50pm). (Update: they appear as sold out on greyhound.ca, but they are available at greyhound.com --go figure!--).
    * JP Flori: I plan to take the 12:10pm bus (to montreal main bus station) which still seem available, like any other bus on that day.
