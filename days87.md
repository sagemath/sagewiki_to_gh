=== Location map ===

Here is a [[https://www.uvm.edu/~cvincen1/images/locationmap.pdf|campus map]] with University Heights circled in green. The check in location for the dorms is also indicated by an arrow. Check in is in University Heights North, but all of our dorm rooms as well as the main room in which we will be meeting (University Heights South 133) are in University Heights South.

== Projects ==

Feel free to add suggestions to our [[/projects|list of projects]]

== Participants ==

See our [[/participants|list of participants]].
If you would like to attend and don't need any funding, please fill out this form: [[https://goo.gl/forms/hWMcMsxVJGTyUnqn1|this form]].

== Lodging ==

We anticipate that most participants will stay in [[https://www.uvm.edu/~arch/?Page=projects/learningcomplex.html&SM=pastprojectsmenu.html|these dorms]], which have air conditioned rooms, private bathrooms and common spaces for work and socializing in the evenings. Participants who are not funded by the conference may stay in the dorms and will pay for the total price of their accommodation by check. Please contact an organizer for more details.
 * Check in is Sunday July 16 at 4pm and check out is Sunday July 23 at 11am; if you arrive outside of normal business hours, please go to University Heights North front desk and call (802) 656-5550. The employee on duty will come and help you check in. Participants may check in and out anytime between the times posted.
 * Each dorms room will contain a bed, a dresser, a wardrobe, a desk, a desk chair, a trash can and a recycling bin as well as the following linens: two flat sheets, one blanket, one pillow, one pillowcase, two towels, one washcloth, one plastic cup and one bar of soap. The room will not have an alarm clock or a desk lamp. If you tend to run cold at night, you might want to bring a second blanket.
 * The rooms have ethernet jacks but no cables; if you would like to use a wired internet connection please bring your own ethernet cable.
 * Refrigerators will be available for participants in a common room. If you require a refrigerator in your room, please let an organizer know; this can be arranged with enough notice.
 * Parking permits will be provided free of charge to dorm residents. If you require a parking permit, please let an organizer know. Please watch for a parking map to be posted closer to the start of the workshop.
 * We will pay the cost of the dorm room directly for all funded participants.

If you prefer to stay in a hotel and we're funding your lodging, please contact the organizers (we can allocate your lodging amount toward a hotel with enough advance notice). Options include the [[http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/vermont/hilton-garden-inn-burlington-downtown-BTVDWGI/index.html|Hilton Garden Inn Burlington]] and the [[http://www.sheratonburlington.com/|Sheraton Burlington Hotel]]. The Sheraton is not downtown but it is closer to the location of the conference.

== Travel ==

If you still need suggestions on travel arrangements, [[/travel|look here]].

=== Carpool ===

 * Montreal -> Vermont:

    * Gonzalo Tornaría: my flight lands on sunday at 14:15 (AA from Miami), not sure I can make it to the 16:15 bus (probably not). Are there no services between 16:15 and 23:30?
    * Marc M.: my flight arrives too late for the afternoon bus. Would be interested in carpooling after 5pm on Sunday (7/16) or early morning on Monday (7/17).
    * JP Flori: Same situation for me (landing from Paris (France) at 3:00pm). I was thinking of taking the 11pm bus, arriving at Burlington (airport... we could share a taxi from there) around 2am. It should be possible to check in at that time according to David. It might be easier to take the monday morning 8:15am bus, arriving at Burlington (transit center, downtown!) before 11am. (Note from Christelle: The transit center downtown is 1.5 miles (2.5km) from University Heights and the airport is 2.5 miles (4km) from University Heights. Depending how much luggage you have, you might need a cab from either location.)

 * Vermont -> Montreal:

    * Marc M.: Greyhound tickets appear to be sold out on Saturday (7/22). I'd like to get to Montreal airport before 7pm (I have a flight at 8.50pm). (Update: they appear as sold out on greyhound.ca, but they are available at greyhound.com --go figure!--).
    * JP Flori: I plan to take the 12:10pm bus (to montreal main bus station) which still seem available, like any other bus on that day.
    * Gonzalo Tornaría: I'm going to Montreal on saturday, staying there for the MCA.

== Reimbursements ==

Instructions for reimbursements will be given on the first day of the conference. If you are '''not''' a US citizen or green card holder, please bring your passport and any visa paperwork you have (I-94, visa stamps, etc.) so that we can make scans while you are here.

== Internet on campus ==

The University of Vermont offers [[https://www.eduroam.us/|eduroam]] on campus. To access the network at UVM, please take a few minutes to set up your laptop before traveling, while you are on your home university campus. If you do not have eduroam, please contact Christelle Vincent to receive a guest log in for UVM's network.

== The k8s server ==

William has kindly provided a server for us to use during the workshop, with 48 CPUs and 256 GB of RAM.  It is running !CoCalc, so you can access it from your browser.

=== Creating an Account ===

You should create an account [[https://k8s.sagemath.org/settings|here]].  You will need a secret token, which has been e-mailed to participants (ask someone if you can't find it).  Once you have an account, someone will have to add you to the Sage Days 87 project; anyone who is already part of the project can do so from the project settings page.  At that point, you will be able to access the server at [[https://k8s.sagemath.org|k8s.sagemath.org]].

=== Git ===

If you will be doing Sage development, you need to set up a terminal that knows who you are (since we're all using the same user when we log in from the browser).  This way we will be able to share Sage installations on the server.  To set this up, open up a terminal (`~/Terms/Admin.term` exists for this purpose) and run the script `~/Terms/setup_gitterm.py`.  This will ask you some questions (name, e-mail, trac account info) and create a terminal for you (`~/Terms/$TRAC_USERNAME_git.term`).  It will also create an ssh key specific to you that you should upload to [[https://trac.sagemath.org/prefs/sshkeys|trac]].  If you're ever interacting with git, you should use this terminal (or the ssh method described below).  In particular, please don't set the git configuration on any of the Sage installations.

Note that by default, it will store your trac password in plain text in a file on the server.  If you don't want it to, just answer "No" to the "store trac password" question, and you'll be asked for it at the beginning of each ssh session.

=== SSH ===

Once you add the public key from your laptop (generated by `ssh-keygen` and then copied from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` for example) to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in the browser, you will be able to SSH into the project using the following command.

{{{ssh da1818ed996d4de6acc6361415b7725d@k8s-ssh.sagemath.org -p 2222 -t .roed}}}

where `roed` should be replaced by your trac username (if you haven't run `setup_gitterm.py`, you can just leave off the `-t .roed` altogether).

=== Sage installations ===

You can create a new Sage installation within a couple minutes as follows:

{{{
cd ~/Src/
tar xf sage-8.0.rc1.tar
mv SageMath sage-BLAH
cd sage-BLAH
git remote add trac git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git
git remote set-url --push trac git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
./sage
}}}

Note that the renaming is very important so that other people can extract from the tarball. Now `sage-BLAH` is available for you to work on a ticket.  If you think you'll be doing a lot of development, feel free to create your own installation (labeled with your trac username); if you're less experienced you might share one as part of a group.

=== Jupyter notebooks ===

Our custom Sages are not currently available from Jupyter notebooks.  If you'd like to write Jupyter kernels to change this, feel free to do so and add the instructions for using them here.

=== Tmux ===

The current !CoCalc terminal implementation has some bugs with resizing inserting strange control characters.  The fix is to type tmux after you've opened and logged into your personal terminal, or to just use SSH.

== Local dining options ==

We will add more details as the workshop approaches, but for now check out the [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A2B4-EmWB1cUQat364SzVJV9aD4&usp=sharing|map]] Christelle made!

== To prepare for the workshop ==

On the first day of the workshop, [[http://people.reed.edu/~westm/|Mckenzie West]] will lead some activities to help novices get oriented with Sage. Stay tuned for more details. Before the workshop, we recommend [[http://www.sagemath.org/|downloading and installing]] the latest version of the source code of Sage, opening a [[https://trac.sagemath.org/|Sage trac]] account and completing the [[https://www.codecademy.com/|Code Academy]] modules on Python and Git.



If you have never done any LMFDB development work and might want to start -- a workshop is by far the
best place to get started. A starting point is have a recent
installation of Sage on your own laptop, on top of which you can run
the LMFDB website software with a little setting up.
Here is how to do it: https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/blob/master/GettingStarted.md

For this workshop, we have dedicated server for readonly purposes that simplifies some of the steps. If you add to your LMFDB directory a file called {{{mongoclient.config}}} with the following content:
{{{
[db]
port = 27017
host = readonly.lmfdb.xyz 
}}}
 then you can run the LMFDB as usual by doing:
{{{
 sage -python start-lmfdb.py --debug
}}}
