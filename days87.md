== Lodging ==

We anticipate that most participants will stay in [[https://www.uvm.edu/~arch/?Page=projects/learningcomplex.html&SM=pastprojectsmenu.html|these dorms]], which have air conditioned rooms, private bathrooms and common spaces for work and socializing in the evenings.  They have gotten good reviews from previous conferences, but if you prefer to stay in a hotel and we're funding your lodging, please contact the organizers (we can allocate your lodging amount toward a hotel with enough advance notice).  Similarly, if we're not funding your lodging but you want to stay in the dorms, this may be possible: please contact an organizer as soon as possible.

== Travel ==

'''If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, please book flights on a US carrier.'''  If you are not a US citizen or permanent resident, this restriction does not apply to you (since we're funding you from a different grant).

There are two main ways to get to Burlington.

 1. Fly into BTV.
 1. Fly to Montreal (YUL), Manchester (MHT) or Boston (BOS) and take [[https://www.greyhound.com/|Greyhound]] to Burlington.
  * Buses depart from Montreal Berri station at 8:15, 10:45, 16:15 and 23:30 and take about 2:45 to get to Burlington (though this can vary due to US customs).  The city bus (747) from the airport takes 45 minutes to go directly to the Greyhound station and runs every 30 minutes (note that the city bus requires a day pass, which costs $10 and can be purchased inside the terminal).
  * Buses depart from Manchester Airport direct to Burlington -- 0:55-4:00, 11:35-15:20 and 15:05-19:55.
  * Buses depart Boston South Station, running 7:00-11:55, 10:30-15:20, 14:00-19:55, 23:20-4:00.  The city bus (Silver line) from the airport takes 15 minutes to go directly to the Greyhound station and runs every 12 minutes.

There may also be carpools traveling from Boston and Hanover, NH.  If you're interested in a carpool feel free to edit this wiki page.
