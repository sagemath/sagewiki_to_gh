= Sage Days 64: Algebraic Combinatorics =

== General Information ==

The goal of these Sage Days is to bring together developers in algebraic combinatorics, Lie theory and representation theory
to discuss needed features and develop code. People who have coded in [[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage]] and would like to get help getting their
code integrated into Sage are also welcome to join.

=== When & Where ===

=== Transportation ===

The nearest airport is Sacramento International (SAC), and are multiple ways to get to UC Davis. There is [[http://www.yolobus.com/news/airportservice.php|bus route 42]]. There is also an [[https://www.davisairporter.com/index2.html|airport shuttle]].

The two other nearby major airports are San Francisco International (SFO) and Oakland International (OAK). From both airports, a combination of [[http://www.bart.gov|BART]] and [[http://www.amtrak.com/home|Amtrak]] can be used to get to UC Davis. In particular, there is the [[http://www.capitolcorridor.org/|Capital Corridor]] line at either the Oakland Coliseum or Richmond BART stations.
