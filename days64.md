= Sage Days 64: Algebraic Combinatorics =

== General Information ==

The goal of these Sage Days is to bring together developers in algebraic combinatorics, Lie theory and representation theory
to discuss needed features and develop code. People who have coded in [[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage]] and would like to get help getting their
code integrated into Sage are also welcome to join.
Any level of Sage experience is welcome, however there will not be basic (python) programming tutorials. So we encourage people who wish to participate to have an understanding of basic python (there are numerous tutorials available online and books available if you want to learn) and basic object-oriented programming (OOP for short).

We would like to point out that a combinatorics related workshop will be held at AIM the following week for people who would like to combine the two, see [[http://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/dynalgcomb/|AIM workshop]].

=== When & Where ===

March 17-20, 2015 at [[http://www.ucdavis.edu|UC Davis]].

=== Registration ===

Registration is free. We have limited funding for travel and lodging. Funding decisions will be made in December 2014.

To register, e-mail either Anne (anne at math.ucdavis.edu) or Travis (tscrim at ucdavis.edu), and please indicate if you would like to apply for funding. You can also add your name to the participant list below with contact information!

=== Lodging ===

Coming soon.

=== Transportation ===

The nearest airport is Sacramento International (SAC), and are multiple ways to get to UC Davis. There is [[http://www.yolobus.com/news/airportservice.php|bus route 42]]. There is also an [[https://www.davisairporter.com/index2.html|airport shuttle]].

The two other nearby major airports are San Francisco International (SFO) and Oakland International (OAK). From both airports, a combination of [[http://www.bart.gov|BART]] and [[http://www.amtrak.com/home|Amtrak]] can be used to get to UC Davis. In particular, there is the [[http://www.capitolcorridor.org/|Capital Corridor]] line at either the Oakland Coliseum or Richmond BART stations.
