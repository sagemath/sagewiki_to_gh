=== Transportation ===

The nearest airport is Sacramento International (SAC), and are multiple ways to get to UC Davis. There is [[http://www.yolobus.com/news/airportservice.php|bus route 42]]. There is also an [[https://www.davisairporter.com/index2.html|airport shuttle]].

The two other nearby major airports are San Francisco International (SFO) and Oakland International (OAK). From both airports, a combination of [[http://www.bart.gov|BART]] and [[http://www.amtrak.com/home|Amtrak]] can be used to get to UC Davis. In particular, there is the [[http://www.capitolcorridor.org/|Capital Corridor]] line at either the Oakland Coliseum or Richmond BART stations.
