== Sage projects ==

 * Add general extensions of p-adic fields in Sage
 * Implementation of Gröbner bases and tropical Gröbner bases algorithm (F4, F5, FGLM), doctest and submission
  * We might finish reviewing the inclusion of openf4 at [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18749|#18749]] and patch it to avoid going through strings all the time
  * And also look at the performance of Singular, polybori, giac, ...
 * For an old list of possible projects, see [[padics]]

== LMFDB projects ==

 * Work on the isogeny classes of abelian varieties over finite fields. See http://beta.lmfdb.org/Variety/Abelian/Fq/
 * Work on Hypergeometric Motives over ℚ. See http://beta.lmfdb.org/Motive/Hypergeometric/Q/
 * Finish up: https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb-collab/wiki//Warwick-workshop-June-2017
 * Sanitize API interface: https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/issues/2053
 * Prototype a Sage/LMFDB interface. See https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/issues/1360 
 * Display Hecke eigenvalues in terms of an integral basis. See: https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/issues/975
