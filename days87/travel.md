## Lodging

We anticipate that most participants will stay in <a class="https" href="https://www.uvm.edu/~arch/?Page=projects/learningcomplex.html&amp;SM=pastprojectsmenu.html">these dorms</a>, which have air conditioned rooms, private bathrooms and common spaces for work and socializing in the evenings. Participants who are not funded by the conference may stay in the dorms and will pay for the total price of their accommodation by check. Please contact an organizer for more details. 

* Check in is Sunday July 16 at 4pm and check out is Sunday July 23 at 11am; if you arrive outside of normal business hours, please go to University Heights North front desk and call (802) 656-5550. The employee on duty will come and help you check in. Participants may check in and out anytime between the times posted. 
* Each dorms room will contain a bed, a dresser, a wardrobe, a desk, a desk chair, a trash can and a recycling bin as well as the following linens: two flat sheets, one blanket, one pillow, one pillowcase, two towels, one washcloth, one plastic cup and one bar of soap. The room will not have an alarm clock or a desk lamp. If you tend to run cold at night, you might want to bring a second blanket. 
* The rooms have ethernet jacks but no cables; if you would like to use a wired internet connection please bring your own ethernet cable. 
* Refrigerators will be available for participants in a common room. If you require a refrigerator in your room, please let an organizer know; this can be arranged with enough notice. 
* Parking permits will be provided free of charge to dorm residents. If you require a parking permit, please let an organizer know. Please watch for a parking map to be posted closer to the start of the workshop. 
* We will pay the cost of the dorm room directly for all funded participants. 
If you prefer to stay in a hotel and we're funding your lodging, please contact the organizers (we can allocate your lodging amount toward a hotel with enough advance notice). Options include the <a class="http" href="http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/vermont/hilton-garden-inn-burlington-downtown-BTVDWGI/index.html">Hilton Garden Inn Burlington</a> and the <a class="http" href="http://www.sheratonburlington.com/">Sheraton Burlington Hotel</a>. The Sheraton is not downtown but it is closer to the location of the conference. 


## Travel

There are three main ways to get to Burlington. 

1. Fly into BTV. The cost of a cab ride from the airport to the dorms is approximately \$10 (less using Uber) and to downtown approximately \$20. 
1. Fly to Montreal (YUL), Manchester (MHT) or Boston (BOS) and take <a class="https" href="https://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound</a> to Burlington (or <a class="https" href="https://us.megabus.com/">Megabus</a> from Boston). 
   * Buses depart from Montreal Berri station at 8:15, 10:45, 16:15 and 23:30 and take about 2:45 to get to Burlington (though this can vary due to US customs).  The city bus (747) from the airport takes 45 minutes to go directly to the Greyhound station and runs every 30 minutes.  Note that the city bus requires a day pass, which costs $10 and can be purchased inside the terminal. 
   * Buses depart from Manchester Airport direct to Burlington -- 0:55-4:00, 11:35-15:20 and 15:05-19:55. 
   * Buses depart Boston South Station, running 7:00-11:55, 10:30-15:20, 14:00-19:55, 23:20-4:00.  The city bus (Silver line) from the airport takes 15 minutes to go directly to the Greyhound station and runs every 12 minutes.  The silver line from the airport is free. 
1. By private car. There is free parking on campus for participants staying at the dorms. The main page has some info on people trying to organize carpools. 

### Carpool

* Montreal -> Vermont: 
         * Gonzalo Tornaría: my flight lands on sunday at 14:15 (AA from Miami), not sure I can make it to the 16:15 bus (probably not). Are there no services between 16:15 and 23:30? 
         * Marc M.: my flight arrives too late for the afternoon bus. Would be interested in carpooling after 5pm on Sunday (7/16) or early morning on Monday (7/17). 
         * JP Flori: Same situation for me (landing from Paris (France) at 3:00pm). I was thinking of taking the 11pm bus, arriving at Burlington (airport... we could share a taxi from there) around 2am. It should be possible to check in at that time according to David. It might be easier to take the monday morning 8:15am bus, arriving at Burlington (transit center, downtown!) before 11am. (Note from Christelle: The transit center downtown is 1.5 miles (2.5km) from University Heights and the airport is 2.5 miles (4km) from University Heights. Depending how much luggage you have, you might need a cab from either location.) 
* Vermont -> Montreal: 
         * Marc M.: Greyhound tickets appear to be sold out on Saturday (7/22). I'd like to get to Montreal airport before 7pm (I have a flight at 8.50pm). (Update: they appear as sold out on greyhound.ca, but they are available at greyhound.com --go figure!--). 
         * JP Flori: I plan to take the 12:10pm bus (to montreal main bus station) which still seem available, like any other bus on that day. 
         * Gonzalo Tornaría: I'm going to Montreal on saturday, staying there for the MCA. 
**If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, please book flights on a US carrier.**  If you are not a US citizen or permanent resident, this restriction does not apply to you (since we're funding you from a different grant).  Note that the <a class="http" href="http://mcofamericas.org/latest-news/mathematical-congress-americas-2017">Mathematical Congress of the Americas</a> is the week after Sage Days 87; if you're interested in attending you may want to plan your travel accordingly. If you do combine your travel, you must obtain, at the time you book your travel, a quote for the cost of your travel round-trip to Burlington. You will only be reimbursed the minimum of this quote and your actual travel costs.
