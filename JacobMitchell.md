I am an undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst double majoring in Math and Computer Science.  As a developer, the open source world is relatively new to me, but I'm excited to take the plunge with SAGE.  If you're interested in knowing anything else about me, just send me an email.  Hopefully I'll be able to make it out to the SAGE Days 7 and meet some of you.
