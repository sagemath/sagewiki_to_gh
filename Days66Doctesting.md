For some doctests (hopefully few of them) tests are very long to run. For example, there is a dramatic
{{{
TestSuite(R).run(elements = [R.random_element() for i in range(3^6)])
}}}
In `sage/rings/padics/padic_base_leaves.py`

Plan of attack:

 * run `sage -t` and `sage -t --long` on all Sage files
 * sort the running time in decreasing order
 * start the list from the begining, read the file and try to do faster tests
