= Dynamics in Sage =

== Introduction ==

Different aspect of dynamics has to deal with computer

  * simulation
  * prospection of combinatorial structure associated to dynamical systems (coding as infinite words, ...)
  * shifts, cellular automata

This page is aimed to be a roadmap for the implementations of various algorithm related to dynamics.

== Subproject ==

  * a project for flat surfaces [[SageFlatProject]]
