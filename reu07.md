=== Projects ===

Tom Boothby, Robert Miller - [:Leon: update] Leon's code

== Wiki examples ==

To include a link:
{{{
[http://www.math.washington.edu/~morrow/reu07/reu.html Jim Morrow's page]
[:Leon: update]
}}}

To add a table of contents:
{{{
[[TableOfContents]]
}}}

To format the table of contents:
{{{
== Top Level, No. 1 ==
== Top Level, No. 2 ==
=== Next Level, No. 1 ===
=== Next Level, No. 2 ===
==== Another Level, etc. ====
== Top Level, No. 3 ==
}}}

To create a new wiki page, simply navigate there, and you will be given a new blank page.

MoinMoin, this particular brand of wiki, also allows you to use LaTeX:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n{n \choose k}x^k$$

$\sum_{k=1}^n{n \choose k}x^k$

$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & \omega \\0 & 0 & -\omega & 0\end{array}\right]$$

Here's how to do that:

{{{
$$\sum_{k=1}^n{n \choose k}x^k$$

$\sum_{k=1}^n{n \choose k}x^k$

$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & \omega \\0 & 0 & -\omega & 0\end{array}\right]$$
}}}

NOTE: The double-dollar notation is a replacement for LaTeX's math environment \[...\], which does not work in the wiki.
