Pairings are bilinears applications that take as arguments two points on an                                                                                    
elliptic curve and return an element of a finite field. Pairings are very                                                                                      
useful in cryptography as they allow the construction of new protocols such                                                                                    
as the identity based cryptography and simplify existing protocols such as                                                                                     
short signature schemes. The aim of this talk is to review the definition of                                                                                   
pairings and to present an implementation using the SAGE software.
