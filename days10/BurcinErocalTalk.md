The first step in algebraic cryptanalysis is to obtain a system of                                                                                            polynomial   equations representing a cryptosystem. Even this first                                                                                           step is surrounded by    many open questions, such as determining the                                                                                         most effective representation of   different components in a cipher.                                                                                          We describe the software package Scrypt,     which automates the                                                                                             tedious aspects of this step and allows easy                                                                                                                  experimentation with different algebraic models and representations.                                                                                          Scrypt    separates the task of describing the structure of a                                                                                                cryptosystem from modeling  the components algebraically. Symbolic                                                                                            computation is used in this process to   delay attaching algebraic                                                                                            models to components, and allow the user to           experiment with                                                                                         different algebraic representations of cipher components later.
