The purpose of the *-Combinat project is to provide an extensible toolbox for computer exploration in algebraic combinatorics, and foster code sharing between researchers in this area. We will present the history, features, and design of MuPAD-Combinat, and discuss the timeline, difficulties, but also great technical and community opportunities that arise from the ongoing port as Sage-Combinat.
