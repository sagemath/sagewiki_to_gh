### An example of implementing automorphism groups: linear codes

I will explain the new generalized partition backtrack software written over the summer (funded by Google), which can be used to classify, generate, and compute the automorphism groups of a variety of combinatorial objects. This builds on about a year and a half of work, resulting in reasonably mature, optimized, literate, open source code. In particular, I will go through the requirements needed for the software to apply to a certain type of object, and the steps for implementing the needed functions to take advantage of it. This will be aided by a particular example: linear error correcting codes. If time permits, results in classifying certain types of binary linear codes will be presented.
