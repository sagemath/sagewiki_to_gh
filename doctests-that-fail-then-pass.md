== Sage doctests which fail, but when later pass on the same system ==

It is not unusual for people to report doctests that fail on a system, but later pass. Sometimes that might be due to a lack of resources, though that's clearly not the only problem. Please list 

 * Your name
 * Hardware
 * Sage version
 * Doctest
 * A link to the the actual part of the log file showing the failure. 
 * Whether use used test, ptest, testlong or ptestlong.
 * Anything else, such as the frequency of the failures. If it practical to test it multiple times, do so.
