OBJECTIVES: This workshop is intended to teach skills in mathematical graphics for research articles, for presentation, and on web pages, to graduate students and advanced undergraduates.

TARGET AUDIENCE: The workshop is aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates in mathematics and related fields. We shall accept applicants from all over the world, but give priority to those based in North America. Programming experience will help, but is not required. Skills taught in the workshop will be valuable to those in nearly all fields of mathematics.

RATIONALE:  Mathematical concepts are often most effectively communicated by images. Nowadays, everybody has the technical means available to produce professional quality graphics to help in the exposition of research, but the skills necessary to produce great graphics are not easy to come by. In this workshop, you will learn the basic skills necessary to produce professional quality visualization of mathematical concepts.

PROGRAM:  Good graphics requires skill in both mathematics and computer programming. Our primary graphics tools will be based on the programming language Python, and interaction with the computer algebra system SAGE.

The program will include lectures and computer labs. Students will work on projects chosen by them and make presentations at
the end of the workshop.

FUNDING: Participants will be housed on campus in SFU student dorms at no cost to the participant. We will also provide a per diem to help cover local costs.

We have funds available to cover some travel costs, but not enough to cover everyone's. We expect most participants to find
their own source. If you need them to be covered, please explain in your application.

APPLICATIONS: You can apply online at

http://www.pims.math.ca/science/2008/08mgvw/apply.html

A complete application consists of
 * Your contact information and background
 * A short description of one or two projects that you might
   like to work on during the workshop
 * A reference from your supervisor. This can be submitted
   online as well. See the application form.

We should receive your application by April 15, 2008. Late applications are at a disadvantage. You will hear by April 30, 2008 if your application is accepted. If it is, you will receive instructions to register for the event.

COMPUTING EQUIPMENT: You will spend a large part of the workshop working on computers.  We have a number of workstations available, but we shall not be able to provide everybody with a workstation. You are encouraged to bring a laptop with wireless networking capability and a modern web browser (such as Firefox 2.0) installed.
