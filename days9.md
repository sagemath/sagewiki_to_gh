Sage days 9:

Mathematical graphics and visualization workshop

Vancouver, Canada
August 9 - 16, 2008

This instructional workshop is primarily aimed at graduate students in
mathematics and related areas. It will concentrate on  practical use of
graphics in mathematical exposition, both in traditional and in new
media.

Tools covered will include the computer algebra system SAGE
(www.sagemath.org) and and the graphics description language
Postscript.

A large part of the program will consist of student projects, either
for
producing new and interesting mathematical graphics or for developing
graphics and visualization tools within SAGE.

Mark your calendars. Details on how to apply will follow soon.
