This is the main organization page for the [[http://socghop.appspot.com/|Google Summer of Code]] efforts of the [[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage]] project.

<<TableOfContents(4)>>

== Introduction ==

Sage is an open-source mathematical software system which combines [[http://www.sagemath.org/links-components.html|numerous packages]] under one umbrella with the goal to provide an alternative to major proprietary mathematical software systems (aka the Ma*'s). The software included in Sage use many different languages such as C, C++, Fortran. However, [[http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/|the Sage library]] which provides a unified interface to these components besides implementions of novel mathematical algoritms is written in [[http://python.org/|Python]] and [[http://cython.org/|Cython]]. Sage also includes a [[http://nb.sagemath.org/|web-based user interface]] where worksheets are stored for each user. 

With it's friendly development community and diverse challenges including 
 * linking together software systems intended to be used through a command line interface,
 * efficient implementation of novel mathematical ideas, 
 * making sure all the components build without problems on a wide range of platforms, and
 * providing a web-based user interface for easy experimentation and collaboration in mathematics
Sage provides projects that might appeal to contributors with different interests and skill levels.

'''If you're a student''' interested in working on any of the [[#projects|projects]] described below, note that these are mostly rough ideas. Feel free to ask questions or suggest other projects by writing to [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel|sage-devel@googlegroups.com]]. Here is the [[gsoc/proposal_template|student application template]] we recommend students to use for their application.

'''If you're a Sage developer''', please take some time to organize the list below and add more ideas. Follow guidelines from the [[http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/faqs|GSOC FAQ]] page. These projects should be doable with less than 3 months of full time work. Projects should generally have:
	* a brief explanation
	* the expected results, way to measure success
	* pre-requisites for working on the project 
	* names of possible mentors (primary one plus backup), information on how to contact them
