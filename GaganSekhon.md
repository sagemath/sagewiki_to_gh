I used a Heuristic approach to narrow down the list of elliptic curves for which $\rho_{2,E}$ is surjective mod 2 but not mod 4 or $\rho_{2,E}$ is surjective mod 4 but not mod. <a href="GaganSekhon/2not4or4not8v3.sage">2not4or4not8v3.sage</a> 

The results of the above program for 2not4 curves is <a href="GaganSekhon/li4.sobj">li4.sobj</a> <a href="GaganSekhon/2not4 output.txt">2not4 output.txt</a> 

I have verified the results of 2not4 list, using a Galois approach, which involves compute the order of the Gal(Q(E[4])/Q). The program I used is <a href="GaganSekhon/2not4galoisapproachv2.sage">2not4galoisapproachv2.sage</a> 

The results of the above program for 4not8 curves is <a href="GaganSekhon/li8.sobj">li8.sobj</a> 

I am working on verifying this result using the Galois approach.
