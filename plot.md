SAGE plotting

Here are some python plotting engines/libraries:

   older/not python dedicated:
       Grace: http://www.idyll.org/~n8gray/code
       PGPLOT: http://efault.net/npat/hacks/ppgplot
       PLplot: http://www.plplot.org

   currently developed / good:
       matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net

SAGE's plotting functionality is built on top of matplotlib, which is a
very extensive plotting library with a user interface that is very similiar to Matlab's plotting.

The interface that SAGE provides to matplotlib is very Mathematica like.
