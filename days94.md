# Sage days 94 -- Sage development days

Sage days 94 took place in Zaragoza (Spain), from Thursday 28 June 2018 to Wednesday 04 July 2018, as a satellite activity of the 16th meeting of the Spanish computer algebra network (<a class="https" href="https://eventos.unizar.es/15634">XVI EACA</a>). 

They featured a series of short courses on subjects related to Sage development. The main target audience was young researchers who want to take the step from writing code for their own use to contributing their code to the Sage codebase. 


## Collaborative pad

We used <a class="https" href="https://annuel.framapad.org/p/sagedays94">this pad</a> to take notes during the workshop. 

For tickets worked on during Sage days 94, we used the keyword "days94": 

   * <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/query?keywords=~days94&amp;group=status&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;order=priority">days94 tickets by status</a> 
   * <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&amp;desc=1&amp;keywords=~days94">days94 tickets by ticket number</a> 

## Mini-course speakers and contributed talks

Topics to cover 

   * The Sage development workflow (Trac, Git, doctests...) 
   * The coercion model 
   * Parents and elements, and their implementation 
   * The category framework 
   * Cython 
   * Using external C/C++ libraries 
   * Communication with external packages using pexpect 
Mini-course speakers 

   * Samuel Lelièvre 
   * Travis Scrimshaw 
   * Jeroen Demeyer 
   * Thierry Monteil 
Besides mini-courses on those subjects, there was some space for short talks contributed by the participants (which could be quite informal); interested participants could just contact the organizers to offer such a talk. 

Proposed talks included: 

   * Rebecca Miller: Applying and Participating in Google Summer of Code 
   * Pablo Angulo: PyTorch, a machine learning framework, and Pyro, a universal probabilistic programming language on top of PyTorch (subtitle: do they fit in Sage?) 
   * Vít Tuček: How Sage is helping me with my research 
   * Sebastian Oehms: Cubic braid groups 
   * Peleg Michaeli: Symbolic discrete random variables 
   * Thierry Monteil: The various representations of real and complex numbers 
   * Mckenzie West: Solving the S-unit equation in Sage

## Instructions for participants

Given the focus on Sage development, we recommend participants come with their own laptop, including a Sage installation that is well suited for development (don't worry if you have trouble installing, we can help with installation during the workshop, but it would save time if it is done in advance). Also, please ask in advance for an account for <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/">Sage's Trac server</a>. 


## Lodging

Several apartments were booked in <a class="https" href="https://www.apartamentoslossitios.com">Apartamentos Los Sitios</a>. They are located in the city centre. The reception is open until 22:30. 


## Location

Talks took place in the main campus of the Universidad de Zaragoza, in the mathematics building. It is about 25 minutes by walk from the apartments (maybe 15 minutes by public transport). 

You can see the train station, the apartments and the event location in <a class="https" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jEMgFXLy7lM-Fenxs8MxKOUnwIklZdkf&amp;usp=sharing">this map</a>. 


## Financial support

The school was partly funded by the <a class="https" href="https://opendreamkit.org">OpenDreamKit</a> project. The LaBRI (University of Bordeaux) and the CNRS co-organized the project via the OpenDreamKit project. We expect to be able to cover the travel and lodging expenses of most participants and speakers.
