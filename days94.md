= Sage days 94 -- Sage development days =

The Sage days 94 will take place in Zaragoza (Spain),
from June 28th to July 4th, 2018, as a satellite activity
of the meeting of the Spanish computer algebra network.

It will be a series of short courses on subjects related to Sage development.
It is mostly oriented to young researchers that want to make the step from
writing some code for their own use, to contributing that code to the Sage codebase.

== Collaborative pad ==

Use [[https://annuel.framapad.org/p/sagedays94|this pad]].

== Subjects to cover (provisional) ==

 * The Sage development workflow (Trac, Git, doctests...)
 * The coercion model
 * Implementation of parents and elements
 * The category framework
 * Cython
 * Using external C/C++ libraries
 * Communication with external packages using pexpect

Besides mini-courses on those subjects, there might be some space for short talks
contributed by the participants (they can be quite informal). Please contact the
organizers if you are interested in giving such a talk.

For the moment, the proposed talks include

 * Rebecca Miller - "Applying and Participating in Google Summer of Code"
 * Pablo Angulo - "Pytorch, a machine learning framework, and Pyro, a universal probabilistic programming language on top of Pytorch" (subtitle: do they fit in Sage?).
 * Vit Tucek: - " how Sage is helping me with my research"
 * Sebastian Oehms - "Cubic braid groups"
 * Peleg Michaeli - "Symbolic discrete random variables"
 * Thierry Monteil - "the various representations of real and complex numbers"




This Sage Days will be a satellite activity of the
[[https://eventos.unizar.es/15634/detail/xvi-eaca-encuentro-de-algebra-computacional-y-aplicaciones.html|XVI EACA encounter]].

== developments ==

Add here the things you plan to work on during the week:

 * (Thierry) Fix oeis internet doctest issues [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25471|#25471]]
 * Try to progress in the inclusion of train-tracks in Sage [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20154|#20154]]
 * Polynomial division [[https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17638|#17638]]

You can tag the corresponding tickets with [[https://trac.sagemath.org/query?keywords=~days94&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=status&order=priority|days94 keyword]] to that it is easy to list them.


== Instructions for participants ==

Since this workshop is focusing in Sage development, it would be
better if the participants come with their own laptop, including
a Sage install that is well suited for development (don't worry
if you can't manage to do so, we can dedicate the first activities
of the workshop to help you with that, but it would save time if
you do that in advance). Also, please ask in advance for an account
in the [[https://trac.sagemath.org/|trac server]].
 
== Lodging ==

We have reserved several appartments in [[www.apartamentoslossitios.com|Apartamentos Los Sitios]]. They are located in the city centre. The reception is open until 22:30.

== Location ==

Talks will take place in the main campus of the Universidad de Zaragoza, in the mathematics building. It is about 25 minutes by walk from the appartments (maybe 15 minutes by public transportation).

You can see the train station, the appartments and the event location in [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jEMgFXLy7lM-Fenxs8MxKOUnwIklZdkf&usp=sharing|this map]]

== Financial support ==

The school will be partially funded by the OpenDreamKit project.
The LaBRI (University of Bordeaux) and the CNRS co-organize the
project via the OpenDreamKit Project. We expect to be able to cover
the travel and lodging expenses of the participants and speakers.
