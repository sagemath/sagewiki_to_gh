Alphabetical listing of things to do (out-of-date and general organise) - [[mrennekamp]] (as of 2017; see file attatched to see files that I removed)
 * All SEP's (Sage Enhancement Proposal) were / need to be removed, as to keep information on Trac
 * [[ams]] booths at AMS / MAA meetings ('08 and '09) and an '09 special session
 * [[art]] duplicates many things, but need to put ALL SAGE ARTWORK EVER MADE into this wiki page ... also broken links
 * [[Tips/bash-completion]] one of many [[Tips]], so not sure what to do with it
 * [[BLAD]] BLAD integration in Sage 'This wiki page is about the integration of the Bibliothèques Lilloises d'Algèbre Différentielle in Sage.' 2011
 * [[bruhat]] project from 2008, S sub n under bruhat order
 * [[cando]] documents "What Sage Can Do" -- decide what to do with it. current version is from 2008.
 * (all) Categories - eg [[combinat/categoryframeworkandcleanup]] and [[DsageNg]]
 * [[Chile]] - tiny page for "events in Chile" (update or no?)
 * [[CodeOfConduct]] not sure why there; would like to see go to official documentation
 * [[CodeSharingWorkflow]] N. Thiery's musings on workflow development. Nothing wrong, but would help to collaborate.
 * Most [[combinat]] probably
 * [[Comparisons]] .... benchmarks, so will need someone to continue updating or doing, else remove
 * [[Cryptography]]
 * What is [[CUDA]]?
 * [[Debate/Collective infrastructure management]] : we have [[Infrastrucure]], so connect these
 * [[DenseLinearAlgebra]] -- If not on Trac, then probably should go as a milestone....? Don't know progress of this either
 * [[dev1]] and all their subpages list what was done at "developer days 1", which is same as [[days8.5]]
 * [[ecc2010]] event page for Workshot on Elliptic Curves and Computation
 * [[Emacs]] tips, so move to [[Tips]]
 * figure out what to do with [[EqualityCoercion]]. mostly a bug
 * another unrelated bug: [[EqualityUnhashable]], where "mathematical equality breaks python"
 * move [[factorization_of_integers_of_special_forms]] to [[Tips]]; but is only mathematical than Sage-specific
 * [[fast_eval]] is 2008 page for a functionality re-doing
 * [[groebner-bases-in-sage-sd2talk]] upload the file from sage.math.washington.edu
 * [[HeckeAlgebras]] is related to [[combinat]]
 * [[IDE]] should go into [[Tips]]
 * bring [[import]] into a [[guidelines]] page
 * [[IpythonNotebook]] -- Missing features for ipython to work within Sage
 * [[K_math_software_survey]] -- Math software in Kindergarten
 * [[LanguagesAndTilings]]
 * [[LanguagesDesign]] -- probably don't need to make a Languages library to compliment a Words library
 * [[Linear_Algebra]]
 * [[magma]] compares magma and sage
 * [[mathbook]] "Mathbook: An XML Application"
 * [[MultivariateGCDBenchmarks]] -- ???? what's this?
 * [[Netbeans]] has been largely forgotten as a [[Tips]] page
 * [[PolynomialAPI]] - supposed to unify multi- and univariate types of polynomials in Sage
 * [[preliminary reading]]
 * keep [[RebaseVsMerge]] as a convention / guideline
 * [[sagebeatsmagma]]
 * some pages exist with weird name schemes (ex. [[sagedays46]] should be [[days46]] which should in turn be [[days/46]]
