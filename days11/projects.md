= Sage Days 11 Projects =

These are projects for [[days11| Sage Days 11]].


== Native Implementation of Dokchitser's Algorithm ==
People: Craig Citro, William Stein, Sourav Sen Gupta, Michael Rubinstein, Rishi Kesh, Gonzalo Tornaria

[[/dokchitser| More details.]]

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/tmp/dokchitser.tar.bz2

Lots of progress.  Lots and lots to do.  Mostly Sourav.


== Cython Wrapping of Rubinstein's L-calc ==
People: William Stein, Sourav Sen Gupta, Michael Rubinstein, Craig Citro, Rishi

  * Michael Abshoff -- update to latest version of lcalc, i.e. the 1.2 release
  
== Screencasts, Documentation, and Video Interviews ==
People: Timothy Clemans

Other projects instead...

== Trac Tickets 3580 and 4249 ==
People: John Voight, Craig Citro, someone with a system similar to Cremona's

Totally DONE!    Real root finding subtleties -- proof = False?

== Work on IPython topics that affect Sage directly ==
People: Fernando Perez, William Stein to provide list of topics and feedback.
  
 * (tricky -- startup time issues!!) %timeit isn't preparsed.  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ipython/+bug/296116
 * mabshoff -- upgrade to latest release (get 0.9.1 -- has "ipython1"; missing snippet of code to make this "usable" for idiots).
 * $HOME/sage.init -- wthread issue; problem is -wthread has to be first option. Solution: sage should kludge around. 
 * way nicer writing out of history as an option (seg faulting, crashing, invidual history overlap): personally, Stein, would be happy basically having the option to have a *merged* history; basically I view the history as a "set"-ish thing, so I don't care about the history being complete and linear for each session.  Watch out about history switching for debugging -- have a temp file with history for just this session.   See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ipython/+bug/296113 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ipython/+bug/296114
 * (progress, startup time issues) annoying valgrind crap?
 * (done) exception on startup of sage look lame.  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ipython/+bug/295798
 * (progress) testing framework/robustness improvements

== test ATLAS 3.9.4 with NumPy, SciPy and Sage ==
People: Michael Abshoff, Fernando Perez

didn't do anything yet.

== Enumeration of relative quadratic extensions ==
People: John Voight, Jon Hanke

????
 

== High Level Memory Profiling and Modular Forms Memory Caching Issues ==
People: Michael Abshoff - understanding of guppy and muppy ought to be helpful; William Stein

wrote a talk.

have a demo.


== Optimize Modular Symbols ==
People: Craig Citro, William Stein
  * tell us what sucks
  * Jon Hanke came up with some nice examples of issues, and is doing a lot more.  Coming along.

== Quadratic forms ==
People: Jon Hanke, Craig Citro, Gonzalo Tornaria, Michael Abshoff

Lay some groundwork.  What is out there?   E.g., Hanke's code, etc.

 * substantial progress; cleanup going on; splitting good and bad; start reviewing good.  
 * general quadratic modules/lattices class
 * goal: in Sage before Sage Days UGA.

== Optimize sage -br ==
People: Gonzalo Tornaria, Craig Citro, David Harvey, (Robert Bradshaw)

 For the Cython side of things, see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/4480

 * add two tickets
 * substantial progress: order(s) of magnitude speedup
 * excellent progress


== Elliptic Curves and Drinfeld Modular Forms over Function Fields ==
People: Chris Hall and Sal Butt

  char >= 5, GF(q)[t]

  * goal: L-series
  * in progress
