 * Fixing bugs in Sage or any of its components
 * Sage Notebook rewrite
 * Applied mathematics: Numpy/Scipy development, Neuroimaging

== Dates ==

 * Monday March 21 to Friday March 25, 2011

 * Seattle, Washington (on the west coast of the USA; *not* in Washington, D.C.), on the [[http://www.washington.edu/|University of Washington]] campus.

 * We have [[http://www.css.washington.edu/room/PCAR+390|PACCAR HALL 390]] reserved 9am - 9pm every day March 21 - 25.  This room is in this [[http://www.foster.washington.edu/about/Pages/paccarhall.aspx|beautiful building]].  '''NOTE:''' You can't get in after I think 5pm without calling or emailing somebody who is already in the building (me? at 206-419-0925) to open the door. 

 * LODGING: Many participants will be staying at the "UWMC Collegiana Hospitality House" (4311 12th Ave. N.E., Seattle)  ([[http://uwmedicine.washington.edu/Patient-Care/Locations/UWMC/Patient-Family-Resources/Pages/Patient-Family-Housing.aspx|mentioned here]]), where I have reserved several rooms.  See [[attachment:collegiana_directions.pdf]] for more information about getting to the Collegiana.
