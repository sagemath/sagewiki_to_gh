 1. SETUP: Let $f = (x+y+z+1)^{15}$.   COMPUTATION: Compute all coefficients of all monomials of $f\cdot (f+1)$, i.e., expand that expression.  

 1. SETUP: Define a function $f(z) = \sqrt{1/3} z^2 + i/3$.  COMPUTATION: Compute the first 5 digits of the numerator of the real part of $f(f(f(...(f(i/2))...)$ iterated $10$ times.
