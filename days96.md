= Sage Days 96 =

Sage days 96 to be held at the Fields Institute for the program [[http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/teichmuller|TeichmÃ¼ller Theory and its Connections to Geometry, Topology and Dynamics]]. The schedule is available on the [[http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/sage-days|Fields website]]. This wiki page will be updated with all documents relative to the workshop (worksheets, tutorials, demos, nice pictures, etc).

== Instructions ==

In order to assist to the workshop you are asked to come with your laptop (though you are also welcome without laptop). It would also be great if you could make sure that Sage is installed on your laptop. The installation procedure depends on your operating system:

 * Ubuntu (versions >= 18.04) and archlinux: install the packages sagemath and sagemath-jupyter
 * gentoo: you can give a try to sage on gentoo (https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo)
 * all other systems (GNU/Linux, OSX, Windows): go to the main SageMath website http://www.sagemath.org/, go to the download section, choose a download server close to your location and download the Sage binary that corresponds to your operating system.
 * If you run GNU/Linux or OSX you can also try to compile the software from sources. The procedure is described at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html

Lastly, in order to prepare the workshop we ask you to think about the following questions and send your answers to both Vincent Delecroix <vincent.delecroix@u-bordeaux.fr> and Anja Randecker <anja@math.toronto.edu>

 * Have you ever heard of Sage?
 * Have you ever used Sage or other mathematical softwares? In which situations?
 * Do you know some programming languages?
 * Do you have any expectation for this workshop? Some topics you want to learn about? Some projects you want to achieve?
