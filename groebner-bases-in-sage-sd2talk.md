= Gröbner Bases in SAGE =
My talk will give an overview about what SAGE offers in speed and features to calculate Gröbner bases and to develop new Gröbner base algorithms. Most of the features SAGE offers are provided through Singular while some are new native code. My talk will also briefly touch algebraic attacks on block ciphers which often use Gröbner basis transformations for their attacks.
