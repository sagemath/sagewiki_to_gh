Monday morning, we will be at <a class="http" href="http://www.ihp.fr/">Institut Henri Poincaré</a> in Paris. 

Instruction to go to the house: 

**by train: RER D, station "Ris-Orangis".** 

From Roissy airport: take RER B up to Gare du Nord then change to RER D to Ris-Orangis (direction Corbeil Essone, check on the board that the train goes there) 

From Orly Airport : take Orly bus to Denfert Rochereau, then RER B to Chatelet les Halles (direction north) then RER D to Ris-Orangis (direction Corbeil Essone, check on the board that the train goes there). Another option is to take Orlyval to Antony where you can take the RER B to Chatelet les Halles.
