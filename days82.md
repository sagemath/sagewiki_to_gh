= Sage Days 84 : Polytopes in Sage =

'''''February 27th - March 12th 2017'''''
'''''Probably Olot, Spain'''''

<<TableOfContents()>>

These Sage days will be focused on the development of the interface to polytopes libraries (ppl, polymake, etc) as well as the creation of a generic number field implementation in C/C++. This workshop is dedicated to people already familiar to Sage or being active in some polytope related libraries/softwares.

There is a very limited number of places. If you are interested get quickly in contact with Vincent Delecroix (vincentDOTdelecroixATuDASHbordeaux.fr).

During the workshop participants will have to cook several times for everybody. Bring your favorite recipies!
