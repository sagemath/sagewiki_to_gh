= Sage Days 82 : Women in Sage (2017) =

'''''January 9 - 13, 2017'''''
'''''Paris area, France'''''

Official French title and pun: Les !SageMath Femmes 

<<TableOfContents()>>

These Sage days are a special event for women* who develop in [[http://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]] or wish to learn Sage. They will include introduction presentations, self training,  and teamwork on
specific projects.

This event is fully funded by the [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]] project.

*The application / invitation process is limited to women, nevertheless all activities of the workshop will be public and open to every one.

== Organizers ==

[[https://www.lri.fr/~pons/|Viviane Pons]] is a researcher in combinatorics and a ''Maître de conférences'' (associate professor) in [[http://www.u-psud.fr/|Paris-Sud University]] (Orsay). She is
part of the [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]] project and has been using and contributing to Sage since 2010. 

[[http://math.bu.edu/people/jbala/|Jennifer Balakrishnan]] works in number theory and arithmetic geometry. She is the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor at [[http://math.bu.edu/|Boston University]]. She has been using and contributing to Sage since 2006.

[[https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~striker/|Jessica Striker]]'s research is in combinatorics, with connections to algebra, geometry, and physics. She is an assistant professor at [[https://www.ndsu.edu/math/|North Dakota State University]] and has been contributing to Sage since 2013.

== Venue ==

The workshop is mostly organized at a rented house in Ris-Orangis (Paris area, RER D):

https://www.homelidays.com/hebergement/p1594881

19 bis avenue des Marronniers - 91130 RIS-ORANGIS

Monday morning, we will be at [[http://www.ihp.fr/|Institut Henri Poincarré]] in Paris.

Instruction to go to the house:

'''by train: RER D, station "Ris-Orangis".'''

From Roissy airport: take RER B up to Gare du Nord then change to RER D to Ris-Orangis (direction Corbeil Essone, check on the board that the train goes there)

From Orly Airport : take Orly bus to Denfert Rochereau, then RER B to Chatelet les Halles (direction north) then RER D to Ris-Orangis (direction Corbeil Essone, check on the board that the train goes there). Another option is to take Orlyval to Antony where you can take the RER B to Chatelet les Halles.



== Application ==

Applications are now closed, The house is full! Never the less, even though we cannot provide more lodging, you are free to join us during the day.
Please let us know by sending an email to: days82@services.cnrs.fr .
