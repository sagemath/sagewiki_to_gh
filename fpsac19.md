International Workshop on '''F'''ree and '''P'''ractical '''S'''oftware for '''A'''lgebraic '''C'''ombinatorics

Although the organizers are primarily in the SageMath community and promote [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software|free software]], all software is welcome, free or not: GAP, Maple, Magma, Mathematica, sage, Macaulay2, ... The interaction will make the richness of the workshop!

Dates: July 8-12, 2019

Location: University of Ljubljana, Slovenia (Faculty of mathematics and physics, Jadranska ulica 21, second floor).

This event will follow [[http://fpsac2019.fmf.uni-lj.si|FPSAC'19]].

== Speakers, Participants, and Projects ==

A tentative list of projects will be made available soon.

'''If you are planning to attend, please "register" by adding your name [[https://hackmd.io/gGaEZ5MsRgmd8aJaz5tdCQ|here]].'''

In the meantime, we would like to know, if you are planning to attend, the following information:

  * what tutorials would you like to see presented?
  * what level of user are you (beginner, experienced user, developer, etc.)?

Please put these information [[https://hackmd.io/gGaEZ5MsRgmd8aJaz5tdCQ|here]].

== Local information ==

There will be no registration fee. OpenDreamKit will fund meals and nights taken by the participants at the local Youth Hostel (Dijaski dom Vic, Gerbičeva ulica 51a, Ljubljana). 
Note that this is *not* the same Youth Hostel than for FPSAC. This one is close by the Sage Days premisses. For other lodging, food, and activity information, see [[http://fpsac2019.fmf.uni-lj.si/local/|FPSAC'19 web page]]. 

To reserve accommodation and meals, please fill in [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3MVFirLN3W69KXJhUTT9Juoi6Rd5CKvTKzz8OPNkzkGLpnA/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;usp=mail_form_link|this survey]] as soon as possible. Note that no vegetarian option is available for dinner.

We recommend that you follow the suggested travel guidelines for [[http://fpsac2019.fmf.uni-lj.si|FPSAC'19]] found [[http://fpsac2019.fmf.uni-lj.si/local/|here]].  Participants are encouraged to participate in both
FPSAC's to optimize value for travel money, especially given the cheap lodging available in Slovenia which makes travel the main cost.
