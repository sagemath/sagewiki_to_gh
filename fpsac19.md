== Travel ==

We recommend that you follow the suggested travel guidelines for [[http://fpsac2019.fmf.uni-lj.si|FPSAC'19]] found [[http://fpsac2019.fmf.uni-lj.si/local/|here]].  Participants are encouraged to participate in both
FPSAC's to optimize value for travel money; especially given the cheap lodging available in Slovenia which makes travel the main cost.
