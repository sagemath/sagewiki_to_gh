I am more of a user than a developer, but I occaisonally contribute.  I use Sage for teaching bioinformatics, and doing research in BKK theory, the n-body problem, bioinformatics, and modeling.  I hope to use Sage more in the future to teach linear algebra, differential equations, and multivariable calculus.Email: hamptonio AT SPAMFREE gmail DOT com
