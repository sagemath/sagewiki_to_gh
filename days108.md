# Sage Day 108: Free and Practical Software for Algebraic Combinatorics 2020 [canceled]

**International Workshop** on **F**ree and **P**ractical **S**oftware for **A**lgebraic **C**ombinatorics 

The workshop will focus on introducing the <a class="https" href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> mathematical software system <a class="https" href="https://www.sagemath.org">SageMath</a> to students and researchers, with emphasis on algebraic combinatorics. All are invited to participate, regardless of their initial software skills - from beginners to experienced developers. 


## Coronavirus Update

The <a class="https" href="https://fpsac2020.math.biu.ac.il/">FPSAC 2020</a> organizers have wrote: "The ongoing Coronavirus epidemic forces significant changes in all areas of life, including international events. FPSAC is no exception. After thorough deliberation with the executive committee, it was decided that FPSAC will not take place this year as a physical meeting." 

The organizers have decided to **cancel** this international workshop as well. 


## Date and Venue

Date: 12 July 2020, the Sunday preceding <a class="https" href="https://fpsac2020.math.biu.ac.il/">FPSAC 2020</a>. 

Location: <a class="https" href="https://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php">Bar-Ilan University</a>, Ramat-Gan, Israel. 


## Installing SageMath

As this is a one-day event, we recommend to have <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> pre-installed on your computer before the workshop. You can do it either of the following ways: 

* Install from <a class="https" href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/binary.html">pre-build binaries</a>. This is the easy and fast way. Go to the <a class="https" href="https://www.sagemath.org/download.html">Download section</a> on the <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> website. It can also be installed on Linux using the package manager. 
* Build from the <a class="https" href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html">source code</a>. This takes longer, but it will allow you to install the latest development version and it is strongly recommended you do this to develop for <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a>. 
If you do not want to install <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> locally on your computer, you can get a free account on <a class="https" href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc</a>. You will then be able to use <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> via a web browser, but an internet connection is required. 


## Local Information

Highlights from the <a class="http" href="http://math-wiki.com/index.php?title=Visitors">visitors page</a> of the Department of Mathematics: 

* <a class="https" href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Public_transit_in_Israel">Public transportation in Israel</a> requires the ownership of a <a class="https" href="https://ravkavonline.co.il/en">Rav-Kav</a> card. If you plan to use buses in Israel, make sure to get one at the airport. The <a class="https" href="https://moovitapp.com/">Moovit</a> app is popular to find routes. 
* The local currency is <a class="https" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_new_shekel">New Israeli Shekel</a>, abbreviated NIS or ILS. 
* On the <a class="https" href="https://www.biu.ac.il/Tour/campus-map.pdf">campus map (PDF)</a> you can find the main pedestrian gate #2 in a red triangle. Gate #40 is closest to many bus stations. You will be asked to present a **photo ID** when entering the university. 
* <a class="https" href="https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/israel">Power plugs and electricity in Israel</a>: For a computer charger you might need an adapter for the <a class="https" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#Israel_SI32_(Type_H)">type H socket</a>. Appliances like a phone charger using Type C plugs (most of Europe) are compatible with it. 
* The campus has eduroam and an open Wi``Fi network.
