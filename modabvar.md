 * Move functions out of abvar_modsym_factor into abvar and delete that file. 

 * Torsion subgroups:
    * Refactor base class
    * Get implementation to work with defining data being (lattice, abvar); compute generators. 

 * Decomposition:
    * three types:
        * ungrouped as simple abvars   (default)
        * groups abvars
        * over End(A)

 * Label function

 * Create from label

 * Create a small mock database

 * Compute the Hecke algebra image in End(A) and find a good clean way to represent for Hecke stable.  New object that is a subring of End(A).   Have methods like {{{R.index_in(S)}}}.

 * Compute End(A) in general.

 * Morphisms:
    * Kernels
    * Cokernels
   
 * Quotients by finite subgroup

 * Intersection pairing

 * Poincare Reducibility:
    * projection

 * Quotients by abelian subvariety

 * Minimal isogeny degree for A, B simple.
