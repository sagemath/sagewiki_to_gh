# Creating a profile

Please fill out **Name**, **Password**, **Password repeat** and **Email**. 

(!) It is best to choose a <a href="/WikiName">WikiName</a> (like Firstname``Lastname) as username to get your changes and signatures link back to your Wiki``Homepage. Your email is needed for you to be able to get notifications on page changes and to recover lost login data. 

If you click on **Create Profile**, a user profile will be created for you. 


# Resetting password

If you forgot your password, provide your email address and click on **Mail me my account data**. The button is only available if the wiki has been configured to support email. 

The email you get contains the encrypted password (so even if someone intercepts the mail, he won't know your REAL password). Just copy and paste it into the login mask into the password field and log in. 

Then change your password to a known value and save your settings. 


# Changing settings

**Save** updates your profile (stored on the wiki server). 


# The Cookie

The cookie will expire next midnight - except if you choose **Remember login information** (after being logged in), then the cookie will not expire. After the cookie has expired, you have to login again.
