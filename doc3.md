= Sage Doc Day 3 =

'''Saturday, August 30, 2008'''

We will focus mostly on doctests Doc Days 3.   Our goal is to raise the coverage score for the Sage library to 60%, since this is a central goal for September.   We need about XXX new doctests to get to 60% coverage.

Coverage scores by module for sage-3.1.2.alpha2  I made this with the following
script run in devel/sage/sage/:
{{{
#!/usr/bin/python
import os
for D in os.listdir('.'):
    if os.path.isdir(D):
        cmd = "cd %s; sage -coverage .|tail -2"%D
        r = os.popen(cmd).read()
        r = r.lstrip()
        print D.upper() + ": " + r
}}}

=== Files with 0% Coverage ===

The snapshot is from 3.1.2.alpha2. interfaces looks much better in the soon to be released 3.1.2.alpha3.

These are all candidates for buggy/dead code.
