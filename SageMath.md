'''!SageMath''', the Sage Mathematics Software System, is a free software system
for mathematics.

It was previously known as "Sage" and, even earlier, as "SAGE".

The shorter name, Sage, remains in use, when there is no ambiguity.

The longer name, !SageMath, prevents confusion with other things called Sage (there are many).
