Abstract:\

\f1\fs32 \cf2 The Li criterion for the Riemann hypothesis was firstly introduced by Xian-Yin Li in 1997 as a simple positivity criterion for the classical Riemann hypothesis, formulated in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function. This criterion was further generalized by Bombieri and Lagarias to a general multiset of complex numbers, and therefore to any L-function.\'a0\

\cf2 One can further generalize this concept to $tau$-Li coefficients that encode further analytic properties of L-functions. The relevant property of the $tau$-Li coefficients $a_n$ of an L-function is their asymptotic behavior as $n\\to \\infty.$ It has been challenging to compute these coefficients for sufficiently high indices (the range one can handle now is ~15 -- see Mark Coffey's papers).

\f1\fs32 The goal of this project is to adapt and enhance Dockchitser's L-functions code (that William Stein has implemented in sage already) in order to make it possible to compute high order Li coefficients for as large a class of L-functions as possible.\'a0
