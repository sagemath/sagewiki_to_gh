[[attachment:sage-mode-0.5.3.spkg]]

Use {{{sage -f sage-mode-0.5.3.spkg}}}.  The following installation instructions are suggested:

A basic install might include the following Emacs Lisp in your .emacs:

{{{
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "path-to-sage-mode-el-files"))
(require 'sage "sage")
(setq sage-command "/path/to/sage")

;; If you want sage-view to typeset all your output and have plot()
;; commands inline, uncomment the following line and configure sage-view:
;; (require 'sage-view "sage-view")
;; (add-hook 'sage-startup-hook 'sage-view)
;; You can use commands like
;; (add-hook 'sage-startup-hook 'sage-view
;; 'sage-view-disable-inline-output 'sage-view-disable-inline-plots)
;; to have some combination of features.  In future, the customize interface
;; will make this simpler... hint, hint!

}}}

== Changelog ==

=== sage-mode-0.5.3 (Nick Alexander, 2009-03-12) ===
* Updated `sage-view' to new version.

* Completely reworked keymaps and added preliminary menus.

* Completely reworked customize interface and added autoload interface
through `sage.el' and autogenerated `sage-load.el'.

* Added some documentation and additional customization options.

=== sage-mode-0.5.2 (Nick Alexander, 2009-02-19) ===

multiple outputs.

=== sage-mode-0.5.1 (Nick Alexander, 2009-02-11) ===
* Added `sage-startup-hook' and made `sage-view' actually usable.

=== sage-mode-0.5 (Nick Alexander, 2009-01-31) ===
* Incorporated Matthias Meulien's sage-view.el.  To enable, try sage-view or
  (add-hook 'inferior-sage-mode-hook 'sage-view).

* Added sage-rerun to restart sage and made C-u C-c C-b (sage-build with a
  prefix argument) build and restart sage.

=== sage-mode-0.4 (Nick Alexander, 2008-06-16) ===
I honestly can't remember.

=== sage-mode-0.3 (Nick Alexander, 2008-06-15) ===
Add sage-build command. Make sage-default-test-* more robust, and add
`sage-send-all-doctest-lines-in-file'.

* sage-build.el: new module for building (sage-build) and running
(sage-build with prefix argument) sage.

* sage-test.el (sage-send-all-doctest-lines): new function. Runs all
sage: doctest lines in a file in sequence. Use with pdb to reproduce
errors found only after sage -t.

* sage-test.el (sage-default-test-command,
sage-default-test-new-command): cleaned up to use sage-build.
