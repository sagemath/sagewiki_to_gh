Several "official" GAP packages are included, all of which are available from <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html">http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html</a>. They are all released under the GPL with the following exception: GRAPE contains nauty (written by Brendon <a href="/McKay">McKay</a>).  

A brief description of each package follows: 

<a class="http" href="http://www.math.wayne.edu/~kaym/research/">braid</a> is a GAP package for computing with braids, covering curves,  and Hurwitz spaces. 

<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/ctbllib.html">CTblLib</a> - The GAP Character Table Library 

<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/design.html">DESIGN</a> is a package for classifying, partitioning and studying block designs. 

<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/factint.html">FactInt</a> is a package providing routines for factoring integers, in particular: 

         * Pollard's p-1 
         * Williams' p+1 
         * Elliptic Curves Method (ECM) 
         * Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC) 
         * Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS) 
<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/gapdoc.html">GAPDoc</a> is a package containing a definition of a structure for  GAP documentation, based on XML. It also contains conversion  programs for producing text-, DVI-, PDF- or HTML-versions of such  documents, with hyperlinks if possible. 

<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/grape.html">GRAPE</a> ("GRaph Algorithms using PErmutation groups") is a package for computing with graphs and groups, and is primarily  designed for constructing and analysing graphs related to groups,  finite geometries, and designs. 

<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/hap.html">HAP</a> ("Homological Algebra Programming") is a GAP package  providing some functions for group cohomology computation.  

<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/laguna.html">LAGUNA</a> ("Lie <a href="/AlGebras">AlGebras</a> and UNits of group Algebras")  package provides functionality for calculation of the  normalized unit group of the modular group algebra of the finite  p-group and for investigation of Lie algebra associated with group  algebras and other associative algebras. 

<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/sonata.html">SONATA</a> ("System Of Nearrings And Their Applications") is a package  which constructs finite nearrings and related objects. 

<a class="http" href="http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/toric.html">TORIC</a> is a GAP package for computing with toric varieties.
