Several "official" GAP packages are included, all of which are available
from http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html. They are
all released under the GPL with the following exception:
GRAPE contains nauty (written by Brendon McKay). 

A brief description of each package follows:

braid is a GAP package for computing with braids, covering curves, 
and Hurwitz spaces.

CTblLib - The GAP Character Table Library

DESIGN is a package for classifying, partitioning and studying block designs.

FactInt is a package providing routines for factoring integers, in particular:
    * Pollard's p-1
    * Williams' p+1
    * Elliptic Curves Method (ECM)
    * Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC)
    * Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)

GAPDoc is a package containing a definition of a structure for 
GAP documentation, based on XML. It also contains conversion 
programs for producing text-, DVI-, PDF- or HTML-versions of such 
documents, with hyperlinks if possible.

GRAPE ("GRaph Algorithms using PErmutation groups")
is a package for computing with graphs and groups, and is primarily 
designed for constructing and analysing graphs related to groups, 
finite geometries, and designs.

HAP ("Homological Algebra Programming") is a GAP package 
providing some functions for group cohomology computation. 

LAGUNA ("Lie AlGebras and UNits of group Algebras") 
package provides functionality for calculation of the 
normalized unit group of the modular group algebra of the finite 
p-group and for investigation of Lie algebra associated with group 
algebras and other associative algebras.

SONATA ("System Of Nearrings And Their Applications") is a package 
which constructs finite nearrings and related objects.

TORIC is a GAP package for computing with toric varieties.
