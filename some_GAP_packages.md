Several "official" GAP packages are included, all of which are available
from http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html. They are
all released under the GPL with the following exception:
GRAPE contains nauty (written by Brendon McKay). 

A brief description of each package follows:

[[http://www.math.wayne.edu/~kaym/research/|braid]] is a GAP package for computing with braids, covering curves, 
and Hurwitz spaces.

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/ctbllib.html|CTblLib]] - The GAP Character Table Library

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/design.html|DESIGN]] is a package for classifying, partitioning and studying block designs.

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/factint.html|FactInt]] is a package providing routines for factoring integers, in particular:
    * Pollard's p-1
    * Williams' p+1
    * Elliptic Curves Method (ECM)
    * Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC)
    * Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/gapdoc.html|GAPDoc]] is a package containing a definition of a structure for 
GAP documentation, based on XML. It also contains conversion 
programs for producing text-, DVI-, PDF- or HTML-versions of such 
documents, with hyperlinks if possible.

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/grape.html|GRAPE]] ("GRaph Algorithms using PErmutation groups")
is a package for computing with graphs and groups, and is primarily 
designed for constructing and analysing graphs related to groups, 
finite geometries, and designs.

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/hap.html|HAP]] ("Homological Algebra Programming") is a GAP package 
providing some functions for group cohomology computation. 

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/laguna.html|LAGUNA]] ("Lie AlGebras and UNits of group Algebras") 
package provides functionality for calculation of the 
normalized unit group of the modular group algebra of the finite 
p-group and for investigation of Lie algebra associated with group 
algebras and other associative algebras.

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/sonata.html|SONATA]] ("System Of Nearrings And Their Applications") is a package 
which constructs finite nearrings and related objects.

[[http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/toric.html|TORIC]] is a GAP package for computing with toric varieties.
