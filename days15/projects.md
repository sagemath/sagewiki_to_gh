== MSVC 2008 port of PARI-2.4.2.alpha0 ==


  Do a port of PARI-2.4.2.alpha0 to MSVC 2008, including MPIR support.

== Low Level Simplicial Sets, CW Complexes, and Morphisms for Simplicial Complexes and Chain Complexes ==

PEOPLE: S. Ault, B. Antieau

  * S. Ault has a CW Complex class up and running (including the chain_complex() method).  The next step is to work on a homology_with_generators method within the ChainComplex
  * B. Antieau has rudimentary simplicial complex morphisms, and is working on the functor to morphisms of chain complexes. No classes are implemented yet.

== Prime Pi ==

PEOPLE: Fredrik Johansson, William Stein, Robert Bradshaw

  * Investigate implementing the Meissel, Lehmer, Lagarias, Miller, Odlyzko for computing the number of primes up to x.


== Steenrod Algebra cohomology (Yacop integration) ==
  
PEOPLE: Christian, John Palmieri, S. Ault, Benjamin Antieau, Bob Bruner

  * A first version is already available. Here's a page with installation instructions: [[Yacop]] 

== Quaternion Algebras (implement odd power of p dividing level case) ==

PEOPLE: Alia Hamieh, Jerome Lefebvre, William Stein.



== Sage/Magma Comparison Audit ==

PEOPLE: William Stein, Bill Hart, Robert Bradshaw, Alia Hamieh, Jerome Lefebvre.

  * See [[sagebeatsmagma]] and [[magma]]

== CANCELLED (already in Sage!) Generalized Bernoulli Numbers ==

PEOPLE: William Stein   
  
  * There is a simple 2 or 3 line formula for generalized Bernoulli numbers in terms of non-generalized ones, which could be used to speed up the chi.bernoulli_number(k) command (for a Dirichlet character chi) by a factor of thousands.
  * [[:/bern:|more details]]
