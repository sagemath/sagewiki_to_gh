== Generalized Bernoulli Numbers ==

PEOPLE: William Stein
  
  * There is a simple 2 or 3 line formula for generalized Bernoulli numbers in terms of non-generalized ones, which could be used to speed up the chi.bernoulli_number(k) command (for a Dirichlet character chi) by a factor of thousands.
