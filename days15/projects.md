These are project ideas for [[days15|Sage Days 15]].

== Prime Pi ==

PEOPLE: Fredrik Johansson, William Stein

  * Investigate implementing the Meissel, Lehmer, Lagarias, Miller, Odlyzko for computing the number of primes up to x.


== Steenrod Algebra cohomology (Yacop integration) ==

  * A first version is already available. Here's a page with installation instructions: [[Yacop]] 

== Sage/Magma Comparison Audit ==

PEOPLE: William Stein

  * See [[sagebeatsmagma]] and [[magma]]

== Generalized Bernoulli Numbers ==

PEOPLE: William Stein
  
  * There is a simple 2 or 3 line formula for generalized Bernoulli numbers in terms of non-generalized ones, which could be used to speed up the chi.bernoulli_number(k) command (for a Dirichlet character chi) by a factor of thousands.
  * [[:/bern:|more details]]
