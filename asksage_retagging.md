Asksage has tons of tags, so that when selecting one of them, the pages tagged with a synonym are not shown. This wiki page aims at finding a good set of representative, in order to merge them on the server.

One example of choice to be made:

* EllipticCurve
* elliptic-curves
* elliptic-curve
* elliptic_curve
* elliptic_curves

So should we rather use singular or plural ? underscore or dash ? CamelCase for existing classes and functions ?
