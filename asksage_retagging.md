Asksage has tons of tags, so that when selecting one of them, the pages tagged with a synonym are not shown. This wiki page aims at finding a good set of representative, in order to merge them on the server.

A first good clean-up task would be to remove all unused tags, those that only appeared in a deleted question.

Concerning the tag redirections and replacements, here is one example of choice to be made:

 * `EllipticCurve`
 * `elliptic-curves`
 * `elliptic-curve`
 * `elliptic_curve`
 * `elliptic_curves`

So should we rather use singular or plural ? underscore or dash ? CamelCase for existing classes and functions ?
