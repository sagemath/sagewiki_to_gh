Asksage has tons of tags, so that when selecting one of them, the pages tagged with a synonym are not shown. This wiki page aims at finding a good set of representative, in order to merge them on the server.

A first good clean-up task would be to remove all unused tags, those that only appeared in a deleted question.

Concerning the tag redirections and replacements, here is one example of choice to be made:

 * `EllipticCurve` (124  questions)
 * `Elliptic-curves` (20 questions)

and one has none of the following

 * `elliptic-curves` 
 * `elliptic-curve`
 * `elliptic_curve`
 * `elliptic_curves`

And here is another example:

 * number_fields × 39
 * NumberField × 21
 * number × 17
 * number_theory × 17
 * algebraic_number × 14
 * numbers × 8
 * number-theory × 7
 * numberfieldtower × 2
 * number-field-ext × 2

And here is another one:

 * mac × 53
 * MAC-OS10.7 × 13
 * mac-OS10.11 × 9
 * Mac-OS10.14 × 8
 * mac-OS10.15 × 7
 * Mac-OS10.13 × 7
 * mac-os10.8 × 6
 * Mac-OS10.9 × 5
 * MacOS10.6 × 5
 * Mac-OS10.10 × 5
 * mac-OS10.12 × 1
 * mac-os10.5 × 1


So should we rather use singular or plural ? underscore or dash ? CamelCase for existing classes and functions ?
