= How to Report Bugs in Sage =

Any and all bug reports are greatly appreciated!!!!  

The Sage developers very much want to know about every single bug in Sage, no matter how small.  We already know about hundreds of bugs, which are [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/|all listed here on trac]], so you may want to search trac before reporting a bug.  However, if you can't be bothered to search trac but found a bug, it can't hurt to report it.   When a known bug is reported repeatedly, that will raise people's interest in trying to fix it.

== Reporting Bugs Via The Notebook ==

Just click the "Report a Problem" link on the upper right of any worksheet.  Note that the form that appears asks a *LOT* of questions, but most are optional, and you can make your bug report completely anonymous if you want by using that form (in case you are shy). 

== Reporting Bugs Via email ==

Join [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|sage-support]] and send us an email.   You can configure your membership so you only read the mailing list online.     When you send a bug report, please please tell us as much as you possibly can about exactly which version of Sage you are using, how you installed it, what operating system your computer is running, what hardware it is running on, etc.   And, if at all possible, be sure to include a complete session that anybody can trivially paste into their copy of Sage to replicate the bug -- the easier it is to replicate a bug, the easier it is for people to get tempted to work on fixing it. 

== Reporting Bugs Via Trac ==

Get a trac account [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/|all listed here on trac]], then click on New Ticket.   This is generally meant for people who are more involved with the Sage project.   First time bug reports are best sent to the sage-support list, so they can be "filtered" by more experienced Sage developers, and so workarounds can be posted, when possible.
