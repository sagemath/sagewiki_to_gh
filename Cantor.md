Cantor's main features are:
 * Nice Worksheet view for evaluating expressions
 * View of plotting results inside the worksheet or in a separate window
 * Easy plugin based structure to add different Backends
 * GetHotNewStuff integration to upload/download example worksheets
 * Typesetting of mathematical formulas using LaTeX
 * Backend aware syntax highlighting
 * Plugin based assistant dialogs for common tasks (like integrating a function or entering a matrix)
