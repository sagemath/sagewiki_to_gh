= Sage Days 79 - November 21 -- November 24, 2016, Jerusalem =

'''''First Sage Days in Israel'''''

'''''Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel'''''

'''Topics: Combinatorics, Symbolic dynamics'''

<<TableOfContents()>>

This Sage Days is the first one organized in Israel under the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) grant entitled: '''“Avenues in Probabilistic and Geometric Combinatorics”''' and the European Commission H2020 project [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]]. The aim of the meeting will be to introduce the software to students and mathematicians in the region, with further emphasis on (but not limited to) '''geometric combinatorics''' and '''symbolic dynamics'''. It will be a great occasion to learn more about the software and for advanced developers to present and improve current tools.

Here is a preliminary program for the workshop. The content of the week is ''very flexible'': more tutorials and presentations can occur depending on the interests of participants. There are side tables in the Library room: small groups of people may use them to work during the tutorials.

== Tutorials on learning python/Sage ==

- For participants starting with Python and Sage, we suggest you to read through some (not all!) documentation listed below

  - [[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/tour.html|A guided tour in Sage]] takes you through basic notions and structures available in Sage.

  - [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/|The python tutorial]] guides you through the basic notions to advanced features of python programming language.

- You can then test your knowledge with these progressive tutorials:

- Polytope tutorial (Moritz Firsching): [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/days79?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Polytope+playground.ipynb|Polytope playground.ipynb]]

- Representation theory and crystals tutorial (Travis Scrimshaw) [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/days79?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=repr_theory_tutorial.ipynb|Jupyter notebook]]

- Graph theory and Linear Programming tutorial (Vincent Delecroix) [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/days79?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=repr_theory_tutorial.ipynb|Jupyter notebook]] [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/days79?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=repr_theory_tutorial.pdf|pdf version of the notebook]]

== Sage Development ==

Sage trac tickets with keyword [[https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&keywords=~days79&order=priority|days79]]. Do not forget to add the keyword "days79" for Sage trac tickets you are working on during the week.

== Lodging ==

We have 10 rooms reserved at the ''Beit Belgia'' (Belgium House) on Givat Ram campus from November 20th to November 25th. Seven of them have two single beds and the other three are ''suits'' with a double bed and a couch. People receiving funding for housing will have a room there waiting for them. Depending on the availability, the remaining rooms will be available for participants not receiving lodging funding. More information to come.

There are also hotels near to campus:

[[http://jerusalemgardenshotel.com/|Jerusalem Gardens Hotel]]

For people that want to extend their stay before/after the workshop, Abraham Hostel is a very good choice of hotel/hostel downtown, close to the tram line and 10 minutes walk to the old city.

== Practical informations ==

If you did not already, please fill in the [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds8fhDkwXBiFRfXqlIW6Z03slffVhkf_1hEVkFQAOsjMbIJA/viewform?c=0&w=1|Information form]]

=== Get to Jerusalem ===

The principal international airport in Israel is Tel Aviv Airport (TLV) located 55km from Jerusalem.

It is possible to get to Jerusalem from the airport:

 i. with a licenced taxi (beige colored with black), just exit the airport and turn left. It costs around 250-300NIS.
 i. with a shared taxi (mini-van) called "sherut", just exit the airport and turn right. It costs 64NIS. No need of reservation, but it leaves once the van is full. Tell to the driver "Givat Ram Campus, Beit Belgia".

The ride takes between 50 minutes and 1h15 depending on traffic conditions

Prior to the workshop we will try to organize us to coordinate taxis if possible.

Taxis do not usually accept credit cards. A ride between TLV airport and Jerusalem costs between 250-300NIS.

=== Meals on campus ===

There are different meal options on Givat Campus. [[http://www.huji.ac.il/huji/images/campuses-maps/campusEdSafra.jpg|Campus Map]]

Among the common chosen options, that all have vegetarian options:

 i. Cafeteria in the Sherman Administration buildind: Israeli dishes
 i. Wise Auditorium (Restaurant Fabricio): Italian/Israeli restaurant with pizza, calzone, salads and coffee.
 i. Sprinzak Building: Coffee with prepared sandwiches, salads, juices and coffee
 i. Rothberg building: Big salad and pasta bar, with coffee.
 i. (more expansive) Belgium House: Coffee and salads and prepared buffets
