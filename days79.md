# Sage Days 79 - November 21 -- November 24, 2016, Jerusalem

_**First Sage Days in Israel**_ 

_**Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel**_ 

**Topics: Combinatorics, Symbolic dynamics** 

[[_TOC_]] 

This Sage Days is the first one organized in Israel under the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) grant entitled: **“Avenues in Probabilistic and Geometric Combinatorics”** and the European Commission H2020 project <a class="http" href="http://opendreamkit.org/">OpenDreamKit</a>. The aim of the meeting will be to introduce the software to students and mathematicians in the region, with further emphasis on (but not limited to) **geometric combinatorics** and **symbolic dynamics**. It will be a great occasion to learn more about the software and for advanced developers to present and improve current tools.

## Sage Development

Sage trac tickets with keyword <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&amp;status=needs_info&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_work&amp;status=new&amp;status=positive_review&amp;keywords=~days79&amp;order=priority">days79</a>. Do not forget to add the keyword "days79" for Sage trac tickets you are working on during the week. 

The documentation concerning contributing to Sage can be accessed here: <a class="http" href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/index.html">Sage Developer’s Guide</a> 


## Status Report

As the first Sage Days in Israel, the main objective of this meeting was to introduce the software to local participants. Around half of the ~45 participants were beginners, we made around 15 installations of <a href="/SageMath">SageMath</a> on Windows, Mac and Linux. The <a class="http" href="http://www.sagemath.org/download-liveusb.html">Live USB sticks</a> were of great help. We allocated a lot of time for beginners to learn from tutorials but also directly from the more experienced users by personalized help. Having a flexible schedule allowed to have such help sessions, but one should not forget to prepare material for all participants to stay busy. 

Here is a summary of the accomplishments of the week: 

   * 47 tickets, see <a class="https" href="https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&amp;status=needs_info&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_work&amp;status=new&amp;status=positive_review&amp;keywords=~days79&amp;order=priority">here</a> for more details. 
   * Around 15 installations on Windows, Mac and Linux 
   * Creation of a sample package for adding to Sage 
   * Around 10 participants got to know Sage better doing tutorials 
   * Experienced Sage users answered tons of questions surrounding usage of Sage 
   * We got 5-6 more experienced users to contribute to Sage by reviewing, reporting, writing tickets 
   * Many discussions and healthy debates about view, plot, show and polytope in Sage 
   * Some projects and discussions will be continued through future collaborations and meetings in 2017

## Lodging

We have 10 rooms reserved at the _Beit Belgia_ (Belgium House) on Givat Ram campus from November 20th to November 25th. Seven of them have two single beds and the other three are _suits_ with a double bed and a couch. People receiving funding for housing will have a room there waiting for them. Depending on the availability, the remaining rooms will be available for participants not receiving lodging funding. More information to come. 

There are also hotels near to campus: 

<a class="https" href="https://www.prima-hotels-israel.com/jerusalem-hotels/prima-park-jerusalem-hotel">Prima Park Hotel</a> 

<a class="http" href="http://jerusalemgardenshotel.com/">Jerusalem Gardens Hotel</a> 

For people that want to extend their stay before/after the workshop, Abraham Hostel is a very good choice of hotel/hostel downtown, close to the tram line and 10 minutes walk to the old city.

### Get to Jerusalem

The principal international airport in Israel is Tel Aviv Airport (TLV) located 55km from Jerusalem. 

It is possible to get to Jerusalem from the airport: 

1. with a licenced taxi (beige colored with black), just exit the airport and turn left. It costs around 250-300NIS. 
1. with a shared taxi (mini-van) called "sherut", just exit the airport and turn right. It costs 64NIS. No need of reservation, but it leaves once the van is full. Tell to the driver "Givat Ram Campus, Beit Belgia". 
The ride takes between 50 minutes and 1h15 depending on traffic conditions 

Prior to the workshop we will try to organize us to coordinate taxis if possible. 

Taxis do not usually accept credit cards. A ride between TLV airport and Jerusalem costs between 250-300NIS. 


### Meals on campus
