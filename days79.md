= Sage Days 79 - November 21 -- November 24, 2016, Jerusalem =

'''''First Sage Days in Israel'''''

'''''Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel'''''

'''Topics: Combinatorics, Symbolic dynamics'''

<<TableOfContents()>>

This Sage Days is the first one organized in Israel under the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) grant entitled: '''“Avenues in Probabilistic and Geometric Combinatorics”'''. The aim of the meeting will be to introduce the software to students and mathematicians in the region, with further emphasis on (but not limited to) '''geometric combinatorics''' and '''symbolic dynamics'''. It will be a great occasion to learn more about the software and for advanced developers to present and improve current tools.

Organizers: [[mailto:labbe@math.huji.ac.il|Jean-Philippe Labbé]]. 

== Dates and Venue ==

Date: 4 days '''from November 21 to November 24, 2016'''

Fridays are usually considered weekend days in Israel.

Venue: Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Givat Ram Campus, (exact rooms TBA)

== Program ==

The program will include '''introduction tutorials''' to Sage, combinatorics and symbolic dynamics in Sage. The meeting will include '''scientific talks''' and there will also be time for '''code sprints'''.

== Lodging, funding, and other practical informations ==

We have 10 rooms reserved at the ''Beit Belgia'' (Belgium House) on Givat Ram campus from November 20th to November 25th. Seven of them have two single beds and the other three are ''suits'' with a double bed and a couch. People receiving funding for housing will have a room there waiting for them. Depending on the availability, the remaining rooms will be available for participants not receiving lodging funding. More information to come.

There are also hotels near to campus:
