= Sage Days 79 - November 21 -- November 24, 2016, Jerusalem =

'''''Sage Days on Combinatorics'''''

'''''Jerusalem, Israel'''''

<<TableOfContents()>>

This Sage Days is the first one organized in Israel. The aim of the meeting will be to introduce the software to students and mathematicians in the region, with further emphasis on (but not limited to) '''combinatorics''' and '''discrete geometry'''. It will be a great occasion to learn more about the software and for advanced developers to present and improve current tools.
