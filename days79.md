= Sage Days 79 - November 21 -- November 24, 2016, Jerusalem =

'''''First Sage Days in Israel'''''

'''''Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel'''''

'''Topics: Combinatorics, Symbolic dynamics'''

<<TableOfContents()>>

This Sage Days is the first one organized in Israel under the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) grant entitled: '''“Avenues in Probabilistic and Geometric Combinatorics”''' and the European Commission H2020 project [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]]. The aim of the meeting will be to introduce the software to students and mathematicians in the region, with further emphasis on (but not limited to) '''geometric combinatorics''' and '''symbolic dynamics'''. It will be a great occasion to learn more about the software and for advanced developers to present and improve current tools.

== Registration & Funding ==

The funding deadline is now passed. It is still possible to register to the workshop until November 4 2016.

Please send the following form to [[mailto:labbe@math.huji.ac.il|Jean-Philippe Labbé]]

 * Name:
 * Institution:
 * Date of arrival:
 * Date of departure:
 * What are your interests in Sage (including coding projects)? What would you like to learn about Sage?
 * What are your programming experiences?
 * Do you use computer algebra systems? Which one?
 * Do you wish to give a talk or present a tutorial? 

''A talk can be on anything related to mathematical development (it does not have to be Sage)
If you have some Sage experience, please consider giving a tutorial''.

== Lodging ==

We have 10 rooms reserved at the ''Beit Belgia'' (Belgium House) on Givat Ram campus from November 20th to November 25th. Seven of them have two single beds and the other three are ''suits'' with a double bed and a couch. People receiving funding for housing will have a room there waiting for them. Depending on the availability, the remaining rooms will be available for participants not receiving lodging funding. More information to come.

There are also hotels near to campus:

For people that want to extend their stay before/after the workshop, Abraham Hostel is a very good choice of hotel/hostel downtown, close to the tram line and 10 minutes walk to the old city.

For more general information about traveling to [[http://wikitravel.org/en/Jerusalem|Jerusalem]].

=== Get to Jerusalem ===

The principal international airport in Israel is Tel Aviv Airport (TLV) located 55km from Jerusalem.

It is possible to get to Jerusalem from the airport:

 i. with a licenced taxi (beige colored with black), just exit the airport and turn left. It costs around 250-300NIS.
 i. with a shared taxi (mini-van) called "sherut", just exit the airport and turn right. It costs 64NIS. No need of reservation, but it leaves once the van is full. Tell to the driver "Givat Ram Campus, Beit Belgia".

The ride takes between 50 minutes and 1h15 depending on traffic conditions

Prior to the workshop we will try to organize us to coordinate taxis if possible.

Taxis do not usually accept credit cards. A ride between TLV airport and Jerusalem costs between 250-300NIS.

=== Meals on campus ===

There are different meal options on Givat Campus. [[http://www.huji.ac.il/huji/images/campuses-maps/campusEdSafra.jpg|Campus Map]]
