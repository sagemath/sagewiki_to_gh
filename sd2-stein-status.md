 * The purpose of this workshop:
     - lots of strategy, planning, brainstorming, etc.

 * Funding ideas:
     - NSF Grants:
          - Computational Math program
          - CSUMS (http://sage.math.washington.edu/grants/stein-csums-06/)

     - The SAGE Mathematics Foundation

     - Parallel SAGE push

 * Mercurial revision control system: why? what? how? -- a very quick tour

     - __index__ method; now v[ZZ(2)] works. 
     - lists with more than 2^32 elements
     - lots of speedups
     - ctypes is included standard

 * Recently added SAGE components:
     - gsl: GNU Scientific Library
     - twisted: Networking framework
