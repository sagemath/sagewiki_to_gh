= Practical information =

== Venue ==

The workshop takes place in a guest house, which has comfortable working spaces,
a cooking and dining area, and a few bedrooms. This favors an intense workshop,
with everything taking place in the same location.

We will set up a wired internet connection and an open wifi.

The Tower can accommodate 8-10 people and the adjacent
Grenier Royal offers room for 6 more people.

The surrounding area offers nice hiking possibilities -- bring hiking/climbing shoes.

Your music instruments and scores, card or board games, etc, are also welcome for the breaks.

== Meal organisation ==

Meals are cooked in turns by the participants for everyone, so bring along your
favorite recipes and dishes! All diets, including vegetarian, will be taken into
account.

The organizers will do some large shopping before coming, and then we will complement locally, as needed. Please send us
the list of ingredients for the dish(es) you plan to prepare. We will be roughtly 10-15 and should plan for roughly 10 meals.

- Salvatore: stuffed bread, I will need flour (a couple of Kg), yeast, salt for the dough; a little garlic, olive oil red
pepper and any long leaf vegetable for the stuffing (the more the better). This is usually better with some sort of sausage inside but if we need to cater to vegetarians it can be omitted. NdLuca: I see Salvatore's origins are close to mine. Some notes for the shoppers: you want "levure boulangère" for yeast, not Alsa or similar, most boulangers sell it, I can grab some at mine if needed. Concerning the "long leaf", those that can be found in France are scarole, chardon (chicorée), cerfeuil, bourrache (hard to find).

- Wednesday evening: pizza from the local pizza truck.

- Andreas:  [[http://www.food.com/recipe/allg-uer-cheese-spaetzle-allg-uer-k-sspatzen-418348|Spaetzle]]:
  farine, oeufs, fromage dur qui a du goût et beaucoup d'oignons. Plus
  de la salade pour manger autre chose que des calories...

- Erik: Sake no foil yaki; salmon or chicken (enough for everyone; chicken probably cheaper but salmon tastier IMO), shiitake and shimeji mushrooms, bell peppers (any colors), carrots, scallions, snow peas, onions, soy sauce, mirin, and sake.  (I will try to bring the mushrooms, soy sauce, mirin, and sake).

- Luca: Tortano (Neapolitan Easter bread, not for the faint of heart). 1kg flour, 200g lard (saindoux), levure boulangère, 200g pork graisserons/rillons (can be replaced with dried sausage or similar), 100g provolone cheese or similar (tomme will do), parmigiano, pepper. Or I can just make pasta/lasagna, whatever :)

- Luca: Pastiera (Neapolitan Easter cake), if someone can bring it in a car.


== Practicalities ==
