a cooking and dining area, and a few bedrooms. This favors an intense workshop,
with everything taking place in the same location.

The Tower can accommodate 8-10 people and the adjacent
Grenier Royal offers room for 6 more people.

The surrounding area offers nice hiking possibilities -- bring hiking/climbing shoes.

Your music instruments and scores, card or board games, etc, are also welcome for the breaks.
