## Sage Days 57, Cernay 2014

The fourth "Sage-Combinat Days in Cernay" will be held at Cernay-la-Ville (40km South-West of Paris, near Orsay), April 6-12, 2014. 

We booked the guest house <a class="http" href="http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/de-toren/">The Tower</a> (and <a class="http" href="http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/le-grenier-royal/">Le grenier royal</a>), a very nice and cosy "gîte", just short of an hour from Paris by public transport. 

This follows a tradition of *-combinat workshops:  <a href="/combinat/SageCombinatDaysCernay2012">2012</a>, <a href="/combinat/SageCombinatChevieWorkshopOrsay2010">2010</a>, <a href="/combinat/SageCombinatWorkshopOrsay">2009</a>,  <a class="http" href="http://mupad-combinat.sourceforge.net/Wiki/SecondDevelopersMeeting">2007</a>... See the links for activity reports and some photos. 

This workshop is also "Sage Days 57". More Sage workshops are listed on the <a href="/Workshops">Workshops</a> page of the Sage wiki. 

The workshop is funded by ANR projects DynA3S, GeoDyM, PSyCo, with material help from the Mathematics and the Computer Science Departments at Université Paris-Sud, Orsay.
