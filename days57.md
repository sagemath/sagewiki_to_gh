= Sage-Combinat Days in Cernay, April 6-12, 2014 (Sage Days 57) (Cernay 2014) =

The fourth "Sage-Combinat Days in Cernay" will be held at Cernay-la-Ville
(40km South-West of Paris, near Orsay), April 6-12, 2014.

Following the *-Combinat tradition we booked the guest house 
[[http://www.cernayvacances.com/CEngels.html|The Tower]] in Cernay-la-Ville.
It is a very nice and cosy "gîte", 50 minutes from Paris by public transport.
