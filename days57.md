== Sage Days 57, Cernay 2014 ==

The fourth "Sage-Combinat Days in Cernay" will be held at Cernay-la-Ville
(40km South-West of Paris, near Orsay), April 6-12, 2014.

We booked the guest house
[[http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/de-toren/|The Tower]] (and
[[http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/le-grenier-royal/|Le grenier royal]]),
a very nice and cosy "gîte", just short of an hour from Paris by public transport.

This follows a tradition of *-combinat workshops: 
[[combinat/SageCombinatDaysCernay2012|2012]],
[[combinat/SageCombinatChevieWorkshopOrsay2010|2010]],
[[combinat/SageCombinatWorkshopOrsay|2009]],
