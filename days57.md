== Cernay 2014, Sage Days 57  ==

The fourth "Sage-Combinat Days in Cernay" will be held at Cernay-la-Ville
(40km South-West of Paris, near Orsay), April 6-12, 2014.

We booked the guest house 
[[http://www.cernayvacances.com/CEngels.html|The Tower]], a very nice and
cosy "gîte", just short of an hour from Paris by public transport.

This follows the *-Combinat tradition of previous Sage-combinat
workshops and MuPAD-combinat workshops before that.

This workshop is also "Sage Days 57".
More Sage workshops are listed on the [[Workshops]] page of the Sage wiki.
