== Sage Days 57, Cernay 2014 ==

The fourth "Sage-Combinat Days in Cernay" will be held at Cernay-la-Ville
(40km South-West of Paris, near Orsay), April 6-12, 2014.

We booked the guest house
[[http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/de-toren/|The Tower]] (and
[[http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/le-grenier-royal/|Le grenier royal]]),
a very nice and cosy "gîte", just short of an hour from Paris by public transport.

This follows a tradition of *-combinat workshops: 
[[combinat/SageCombinatDaysCernay2012|2012]],
[[combinat/SageCombinatChevieWorkshopOrsay2010|2010]],
[[combinat/SageCombinatWorkshopOrsay|2009]], 
[[http://mupad-combinat.sourceforge.net/Wiki/SecondDevelopersMeeting|2007]]...
See the links for activity reports and some photos.

This workshop is also "Sage Days 57".
More Sage workshops are listed on the [[Workshops]] page of the Sage wiki.

The workshop is funded by ANR projects DynA3S, GeoDyM, PSyCo, with material help from the Mathematics and the Computer Science Departments at Université Paris-Sud, Orsay.
