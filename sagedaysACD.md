= Sage Days: Arithmetic and Complex Dynamics =

== November 7â€“November 11, 2013, Florida Institute of Technology, FL ==

This is a 4-day workshop which will include a combination of mathematical talks, Sage tutorials, and Sage development. The two main goals are to promote and to improve the dynamical systems functionality in Sage. Beginning at ICERM in Spring 2012 some base functionality for dynamical systems was implemented for Sage. There remains a significant amount of work to be done, ranging from reviewing patches, migrating stand-alone algorithms into Sage, implementing existing algorithms, and many more.  Users new to Sage and Sage development are welcome.

=== Schedule ===

There will be a few talks and tutorials in the mornings but most of the time will be devoted to working on Sage code.  A precise schedule is yet to be determined.

Conference activities will begin Thursday morning and conclude Sunday afternoon.
