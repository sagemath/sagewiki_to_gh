= Sage Days: Arithmetic and Complex Dynamics =

== November 7â€“November 10, 2013, Florida Institute of Technology, FL ==

This is a 4-day workshop that will include a combination of mathematical talks, Sage tutorials, and Sage development. The main goal is to promote and improve the dynamical systems functionality in Sage.  Some base functionality for dynamical systems has been implemented for Sage, beginning at ICERM in Spring 2012. There remains a significant amount of work to be done, ranging from reviewing patches, migrating stand-alone algorithms into Sage, implementing existing algorithms, and many more activities.  Users new to Sage and Sage development are welcome.

See the [[http://wiki.sagemath.org/dynamics/ArithmeticAndComplex | wiki page]] for information on the current status of Arithmetic and Complex Dynamics in Sage.
