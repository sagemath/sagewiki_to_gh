 * Viewing Sage objects with a PDF viewer (INSERT CREDIT) -- Implements the option {{{viewer="pdf"}}} for the command {{{view()}}} so that one can invoke this command in the form {{{view(object, viewer="pdf")}}} in order to view {{{object}}} using a PDF viewer. Typical uses of this new optional argument include:
  * You prefer to use a PDF viewer rather than a DVI viewer.
  * You want to view LaTeX snippets which are not displayed well in DVI viewers (e.g. graphics produced using tikzpicture).
