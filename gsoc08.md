== Potential Projects ==

 * Make groups in Sage fast and robust
 * Extend Nice to the generality of Leon

 * Notebook
  * Use standard javascript library (jquery?)
  * Standardize api to communicate with Sage

 * Cython
  * Improve C++ support
    * better integration of stl classes (vector, list, etc.)
    * automatically generated constructor, destructor
  * automatic parallelization via thread pools
  * improve code generaton support to have better code dependency checking.
  * glib/high performance c libary integration
  * Add multiple inheritance support
  * Attractive features from Aldor (www.aldor.org)
 * Calculus Improvements - Gary Furnish
  * Cython version of symbolics
  * Differential Geometry Support via the new symbolics system.
  * Specifically I would intend to use the new symbolics system to implement things such as integration over manifolds, 1-forms, Tensors, etc.  A Paragraph(or more) on this project is forthcoming.  

== Potential Mentors ==
 * William Stein
