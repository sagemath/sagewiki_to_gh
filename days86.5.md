= Sage Days 86.5: PIMS Workshop on Computational Arithmetic Geometry =

June 5-9, 2017, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada

http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~nbruin/WCAG2017/

This SageDays/workshop emphasizes on computational arithmetic geometry. So far we have 4 programming projects:

1. Basic arithmetic in function fields

2. Fast point adding on jacabians of genus 2 imaginary hyperelliptic curves

3. Riemann surfaces: Numerical computation of endomorphism rings

4. P-adic computation in divisor class groups
