=  Tensor products, quotients, etc., of free modules =

Comment from Mike:  I'm highly interested in this functionality as I need it for a lot of things.  It would be nice to be able to tensor over rings other than just the base ring.

Soroosh's Wish List: Here is a list of things that I think it would be nice to have in Sage. I think some of them are in already.

 * kernel
 * cokernel
 * torsion: Given R-module M and an R-Ideal I, construct the submodule $M[I]=\{m \in M | xm=0 \mbox{ for all } x \in I\}$
 * intersection: Given R-module M and two submodules $N_1$ and $N_2$, find the submodule $N_1 \cap N_2$
 * sum: Given R-module M and two submodules $N_1$ and $N_2$, find the submodule $N_1+N_2$
 * tensor product
 * hom module: Given R-modules $M_1$ and $M_2$, construct the module $Hom_R(M_1, M_2)$
 * Change of ring: Given R-modules M and an R-algebra A, construct the A-module $M \otimes A$.
 * Annihilator
 * Rank: Calculate the rank of an R-module M.
 * direct sum
 * treating ideals as an R-modules.
