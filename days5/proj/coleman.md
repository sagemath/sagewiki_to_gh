The main goal was to put together a p-adic heights calculator for hyperelliptic curves. Before we have extensions of p-adics, we could: 

* Write a tiny integrals calculator for Weierstrass residue discs. 
* Expand a rational function with poles only in Weierstrass residue discs as a power series. 
* Implement Besser's techniques for calculating with local indices. 
After that, we could: 

* Implement full Coleman integration between points defined over extension fields. (Beware: this requires a semilinear version of the fundamental linear system.) 
Longer term projects could include: 

* Develop a version of Harvey's algorithm for computing Coleman integrals. 
* Come up with a good framework for doing iterated Coleman integrals (for use in the nonabelian Chabauty method).
