= Weekly SageMath user group meeting in Montreal =

As a follow up to [[days86|Sage Days 86]], and restarting the
tradition of [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/LaCIMSageFridays|LaCIM's Sage Fridays]],
there will be a weekly SageMath meeting this Spring in
Montreal. This will be the occasion to get together, help each other,
work on our pet Sage projects, share expertise, ... Whether you would
like to discover Sage, get help on specific issues, or participate
to coding sprints, you are welcome!

The program will
be informal and improvised at the beginning of each meeting according
to the participants wishes and needs.

The meeting will be hosted alternatively at CRM during the workshops
of the thematic semester
