 * Implement Strassen (variant) for dense matrix reduction. The result should be faster than anything else available. Greg has two strategies in mind. We'll implement both and compare their speed.
 * Improve/implement multi-core matrix multiplication and if feasible multi-core reduction
 * If there is time: sparse matrix techniques
