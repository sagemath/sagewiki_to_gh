## Stuff I have done/been working on during Sage Dev 1


### LinBox 1.1.6 rc0

* tried several ways of getting rid of gmp++ (required for debianization). ==> rely on Givaro's 
* integrated Sage's linbox_wrap interface in the <a href="/LinBox">LinBox</a> library 
* fixing bugs in <a href="/LinBox">LinBox</a> and Givaro,... 
* testing phase -> integration in sage-3.0.4 

### Dense Linear Algebra over GF(2)

* Design of the Matrix Multiply based Echelon decomposition 

* learned a lot on the design and tricks of M4RI 
* already done  
      * TSRM,  
      * generalization of matrix windows and algorithms working on them, to any dimensions 
      * LQUP (close to done 
* Still to be done 
      * extensive testing of some routines 
      * trtri (triangular inversion) 
      * trtrm (triangular triangular matmul) 

### Algorithms for matrices overs Z and Zp[X]

* Theory: discussions and new insights with A Storjohann (computing Smith form transformation matrices) 
* practice: new libraries 

### Benchmark(et)ing

* parallel ATLAS and fflas-ffpack: 70 Gffops 
* lobbying for introduction of Tbops for benchmark**ing M4RI -> 1.2Tbops 

### Playing with words

* some nicer prononciations for weird acronyms: M4RI and eMPIRe
