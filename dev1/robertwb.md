      * We're almost there, most doctests pass again (plus lots of other testing) <a class="http" href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/days7/coercion/todo">wiki</a> 
      * Thanks for all those who pitched in and helped! 
* Cython 
      * We settled on out buffer interface for <a href="/NumPy">NumPy</a> integration <a class="http" href="http://wiki.cython.org/enhancements/buffer">buffers</a>
