I spent most of my time this week focusing on

 * Coercion
   * Merged into sage-main tip. 
   * We're almost there, most doctests pass again (plus lots of other testing)
   * Thanks for all those who pitched in and helped!

 * Cython
   * Settled on out buffer interface for NumPy integration
   * Parse tree transformation infrastructure
   * Closures/Generators (not done yet)
