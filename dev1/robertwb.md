I spent most of my time this week focusing on

 * Coercion
   * Merged into sage-main tip. [http://cython.org/coercion/hgwebdir.cgi/sage-coerce-3.0.3/ repo]
   * We're almost there, most doctests pass again (plus lots of other testing) [http://wiki.sagemath.org/days7/coercion/todo wiki]
   * Thanks for all those who pitched in and helped!

 * Cython
   * We settled on out buffer interface for NumPy integration [http://wiki.cython.org/enhancements/buffer buffers]
   * Looked into integrating Pex features [http://wiki.cython.org/enhancements/pex pex]
   * Parse tree transformation infrastructure
   * Closures/Generators (not done yet)
