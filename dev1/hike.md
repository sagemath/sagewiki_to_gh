* Clément Pernet (3 more people)

Tom's comments 

* Hiking on Sunday means that other people will be out hiking.  Hiking during the week is better. 
* Hiking in the afternoon isn't as good of an idea as hiking in the morning. 
* Hiking in the morning during the week is dumb, because we'd have to fight traffic. 
* Bring food.  I'll have lunch & water enough for me.
