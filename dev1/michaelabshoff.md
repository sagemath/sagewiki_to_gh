Things I did a Sage Dev1:

 * Sage 3.0.3 release
 * work on building parallel ATLAS
 * pushing IML patches upstream with Arne Storjohann
 * ffpack benchmarking with Clement Pernet (70GFlops over GF(11) using 20 Itanium CPUs in parallel for matrix matrix multiply)
 * hunt bugs in modular forms code, pickling and python
 * quality improvement discussion of Sage - see [:QualityControl]
