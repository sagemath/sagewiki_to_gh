## Funding

If you're interested in attending, there may be funding for you.   Email <a href="mailto:wstein@gmail.com">wstein@gmail.com</a>, and include a cc to <a href="mailto:beezer@ups.edu">beezer@ups.edu</a>.  Include information about projects you have in mind for the notebook or Sage. 

* **Be sure to buy your plane ticket on a US carrier.** 

## Important: Lodging

**There are only limited rooms available in the campus vicinity, so please make arrangements immediately.** 

We have limited rooms available at the Collegiana Inn.  This operation is somewhere between a dormitory and a hotel, perhaps "boarding house" describes it.  Rooms are designed to be shared and have their own bathrooms.  You can read a bit more about the Collegiana on the <a href="/uw-local-info">local information</a> page.  If we fill these rooms, or if you prefer less-rustic accomodations, suggestions for lodging are available on the <a href="/days41/travel#hotels">travel</a> page.  You should make these arrangements yourself.  If you have been approved for funding, then you will be reimbursed.
