== Funding ==

If you're interested in attending, there may be funding for you.   Email wstein@gmail.com, and include a cc to beezer@ups.edu.  Include information about projects you have in mind for the notebook or Sage.

 '''Be sure to buy your plane ticket on a US carrier.'''

== Important: Lodging ==

'''There are only limited rooms available in the campus vicinity, so please make arrangements immediately.'''

We have limited rooms available at the Collegiana Inn.  This operation is somewhere between a dormitory and a hotel, perhaps "boarding house" describes it.  Rooms are designed to be shared and have their own bathrooms.  You can read a bit more about the Collegiana on the [[uw-local-info|local information]] page.  If we fill these rooms, or if you prefer less-rustic accomodations, suggestions for lodging are available on the [[days41/travel#hotels|travel]] page.  You should make these arrangements yourself.  If you have been approved for funding, then you will be reimbursed.

[[http://xchat.org/|Xchat]] is a popular cross-platform choice.
