== The SAGE Mathematics Foundation ==

SAGE clearly needs a '''SAGE Foundation'''. 

There is already something called [http://thesagefoundation.org/ The SAGE foundation] in New Jersey. (The financial section of their website is interesting, since they post several relevant IRS documents.)

   QUESTION 1: Can I create another "SAGE Foundation", or do foundation names have to be unique?  This is basically a question about IRS tax codes, I think. 

== Mission Statement ==

 * Whatever this turns out to be (there will be lots of discussion at SD2), here are some questions which hopefully this statement will help answer:
   * Why does the SAGE Mathematics Foundation exist? What is the purpose of SAGE?
   * What is the Foundation going to do to achieve this purpose?
   * What are our guiding principles? 

 * Examples: [http://www.python.org/psf/mission/ Python Foundation] and the [http://www.maa.org/Aboutmaa/mission.html MAA].

== Organizational Structure ==

== Treasurer ==

Do any other computater algebra systems, e.g., Axiom, Magma, GAP, PARI, etc., 
have a foundation?

 * GAP has [http://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/centres.html GAP Centers] and a [http://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/Council/council.html GAP Council]. The ''Council'' provides broad policy advice for the future development of GAP, among other things. (The Council chairman serves as the "editor" of the GAP webpages, though he is not the webmaster, and also as an "editor in chief" of the "GAP packages".) See the web pages for more details. The ''Centers'' are physical locations where GAP expertise is found (for example, St. Andrews). The developers located there are Council members and have several "possible tasks": (1) run GAP-related conferences, (2) use their local computer facilities to test and develop GAP, (3) try to raise money, ... . See the web pages for more details.
