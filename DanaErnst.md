=== about ===
My name is Dana Ernst and I am an assistant professor in the [[http://www.plymouth.edu/math/ | Mathematics Department]] at [[http://plymouth.edu | Plymouth State University]] in [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=plymouth,+nh&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=60.417788,100.019531&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=p&amp;z=14 | Plymouth, NH]].  My primary research interests are in the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic structures. More specifically, I study the combinatorics of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group | Coxeter groups]] and their associated [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecke_algebra | Hecke algebras]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazhdan%E2%80%93Lusztig_polynomial | Kazhdan--Lusztig theory]], generalized [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperley-Lieb_algebra | Temperley--Lieb algebras]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_algebra | diagram algebras]], and [[http://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/books/heaps.ps | heaps of pieces]].  By employing combinatorial tools such as diagram algebras and heaps of pieces, one can gain insight into algebraic structures associated to Coxeter groups, and, conversely, the corresponding structure theory can often lead to surprising combinatorial results. I am also very passionate about mathematics education. 


The combinatorial nature of my research naturally lends itself to collaborations with advanced undergraduate students, and my goal is to incorporate undergraduates in my research as much as possible.  See my [[http://oz.plymouth.edu/~dcernst/research.html|research page]] for more information.

Furthermore, I am very passionate about mathematics education.  Recently, I have become interested in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry-based_learning|inquired-based learning]] and the [[http://www.discovery.utexas.edu/rlm/method.html|Moore method]] for teaching mathematics.   This educational paradigm has transformed my teaching.

I am also interested in utilizing technology to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics.  In particular, I choose free and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source|open-source]] software and technologies when appropriate.  For example, I have been incorporating [[http://sagemath.org|Sage]] and [[http://lurch.sourceforge.net/|Lurch]] into my teaching.  Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.  Lurch is open-source mathematics validation software with the ability to check the steps of your work in many areas of mathematics, from calculus to logic.  I also make use of wikis for some of my courses to enhance collaboration and to introduce students to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX|LaTeX]].  For a recent example of one of my course wikis, go [[http://ma4140.wikidot.com|here]].

In addition to using free and open-source software, I am inspired by the recent [[http://iae-pedia.org/Open_Source_Textbooks|open-source textbook]] movement and I strongly believe that educators should choose free, open-source, or low cost textbooks when a viable alternative exists.  For a selection of free and/or open-source textbooks, go [[http://linear.ups.edu/opentexts.html|here]].

I am also the co-organizer of the [[http://oz.plymouth.edu/~dcernst/Seminars/seminars.html|PSU Mathematics Seminars]].

Lastly, I am an avid cyclist and rock climber and also enjoy hikes with the family and drinking copious amounts of [[http://www.montealto.com/home.php | coffee]].
