We'll be drawing our projects from the following sources.

 * The wiki page for [[padics|enhancements to p-adics in Sage]].  
 * The list of [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/query?status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&component=padics&order=priority|open p-adic tickets on Trac]].
 * Computational projects proposed by participants on Sunday afternoon.

As the workshop progresses we'll be using this space to organize work on these projects.  You should feel free now to add projects you'd like to see worked on either to this page or the [[padics|the enhancements page]].
