We'll be drawing our projects from the following sources.

 * The wiki page for [[padics|enhancements to p-adics in Sage]].  
 * The list of [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/query?status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&component=padics&order=priority|open p-adic tickets on Trac]].
 * Computational projects proposed by participants on Sunday afternoon.

== Sunday Project Proposals ==

 * [[/PowerSeries]] -- separate precision from arithmetic, come up with applications that it will be used for: power series that converge in a particular p-adic disc.  Modules over these rings.
 * [[/Factoring]] -- work on factoring of polynomials over local fields.
 * [[/Templates]] -- templates for elements of p-adic fields.
 * [[/SymbolicIntegration]] -- symbolic integration over p-adics.  p-adic Igusa zeta functions.  Get rational functions in a symbolic p.  Look at Denef's webpage.
 * [[/LogarithmsForExt]] -- logarithms and exponentials for p-adic extension fields.
 * [[/FunctionFields]] -- Hess' automorphism algorithm for finding isomorphisms between function fields.
 * [[/WittVectors]] -- Witt vectors over general rings.
 * [[/HilbertSymbols]] -- General Hilbert symbols for p-adic fields.
 * [[/Completions]] -- Completions of number fields.
 * [[/LinearAlgebra]] -- think.  then implement.
 * [[/Inversion|Inversion]] -- Speed up inversion.
