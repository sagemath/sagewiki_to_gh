## Description

Implement a native inversion for finite extensions of Qp.  


## Progress

Implemented inversion for elements in Qp. 


## Work

Still needs to be editted for syntax conventions, error messages, examples, and documentation. Also requires optimization and improved code.  

Code should eventually be replaced by superior FLINT code by Sebastian Pancratz; requires FLINT 2 to be incorporated into Sage. See <a class="http" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12173">#12173</a>.
