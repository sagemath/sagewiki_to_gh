=== Description ===

The goal of this project is to reimplement elements of Zp and Qp using the ideas from sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi. These templates can then be used to much more easily implement new p-adics classes.

=== Current Progress ===

See [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12555|#12555]].
