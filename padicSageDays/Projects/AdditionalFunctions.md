Submitted patch for Artin-Hasse exponential.
needs: doctests that verify that it ''is'' the AHE; would be nice to have an argument (m?) that gives you exp(x+...+x^(p^m)/p^m)

Got a copy of some sage code for the p-adic gamma function from Cameron Franc.  Optimizing.

If there are other functions you'd like to see added please list them.
