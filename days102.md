= Sage Days 102 : University of Ibadan, Nigeria =

'''''July 15 - 19, 2019'''''
'''''Ibadan, Nigeria'''''

<<TableOfContents()>>

These Sage days are for locals to Nigeria and the neighboring region (as well as any Sage developers who wish to attend) who develop in [[http://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]] or wish to learn Sage. They will include introductory training, presentations, and break-out sessions for specific areas of interest as directed by the attendees. There is no initial knowledge needed, everyone is welcome whether they are new Sage learners or Sage expert. We believe in diversity in backgrounds and experiences.

Travel for some participants coming from outside Nigeria can be covered [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]] project.

'''SOME DETAILS TBD'''

The event will be workshop style and most of the schedule will be decided by the participants as needed.

The first two days may consist of a [[https://software-carpentry.org/|Software Carpentry]] style workshop, especially targeted to those who are new to scientific and mathematical computing with open source tools including basic skills in learning the command-line shell, the [[https://jupyter.org/|Jupyter Notebook]], the [[https://www.python.org/|Python]] programming language (the implementation language of SageMath, and one of the leaders in open science), and version control using the [[https://git-scm.com/|git]] version control system and source code hosting/collaboration sites like [[https://github.com/|GitHub]].  '''TBD: Maybe some R as well, if there is interest?  One of our potential instructors teaches it.'''


We will continue then with introductory presentations and tutorials especially targeted at those who don't know much Sage. Participants will also have an occasion to present their mathematical and/or Sage-related projects to the group.  The rest of week will be dedicated to coding either individually or in groups, and onboarding newcomers to the process of doing development for Sage and the technologies involved. We will plan other presentations and tutorials depending on the needs and wishes of the participants.
