= Sage Days 13: Athens, Georgia =

== Date ==

 * Feb 28 - March 2, 2009

== Location ==

The event will be held at the [[http://www.uga.edu/visit/directions.html|University of Georgia]] at Athens.

== How to get to Athens ==

he preferred way of getting to Athens is to fly into Atlanta (ATL), and then take the [[http://www.aaaairportexpress.com/routes/athens.html|AAA Shuttle express]] shuttle to the Georgia center.  The shuttle takes about 1.5 hours and costs about $45 each way.  Since the shuttle sometimes fills up, it is recommended that you call ahead and make both arrival and departure reservations.  The shuttle phone number is (800) 354-7874 or (404) 767-2000.

We recommend that you arrive on Friday Feb 28th, and there will be an informal dinner at a local restaurant for those who arrive on/before the 4:45pm shuttle (arrives 6:30pm to UGA).
