= Sage Days 13: Athens, Georgia =

== Date ==

 * Feb 28 - March 2, 2009

== Schedule ==

Preliminary [[days13/schedule|schedule]]: (as [[attachment:SD13+Tentative+schedule+(as+of+2-17-2009).pdf|pdf]])

== Location ==

The event will be held at the [[http://www.uga.edu/visit/directions.html|University of Georgia]] at Athens.

We have a block of rooms for the conference reserved at the [[http://www.georgiacenter.uga.edu/index.phtml|Georgia Center]] on campus.  They already have a list of confirmed participants, but everyone should confirm their arrival/departure date with the reservations office by calling (706) 542-1181 and mentioning either that you are with "SAGE Days" or event number 68207.  Only single rooms are available, and all rooms are non-smoking.

== How to get to UGA ==

The preferred way of getting to Athens is to fly into Atlanta (ATL), and then take the [[http://www.aaaairportexpress.com/routes/athens.html|AAA Shuttle express]] shuttle to the Georgia center.  The shuttle takes about 1.5 hours and costs about $45 each way.  Since the shuttle sometimes fills up, it is recommended that you call ahead and make both arrival and departure reservations.  The shuttle phone number is (800) 354-7874 or (404) 767-2000.

We recommend that you arrive on Friday Feb 27th, and there will be an informal dinner at a local restaurant for those who arrive on/before the 4:45pm shuttle (arrives 6:30pm to UGA).
