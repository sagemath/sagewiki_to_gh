= Sage Days 13: Athens, Georgia =

== Goals: ==
  * Introdution to SAGE for new users/developers
  * Discuss goals for quadratic forms code, and what is currently missing. E.g.:
    * Spinor genera
    * p-Neighbors
    * Enumerating a genus of quadratic forms
    * Higher local densities
  * Discuss generalizations of existing code to Hermitian forms and number fields 
  * Write new code for quadratic forms and lattices (??)
