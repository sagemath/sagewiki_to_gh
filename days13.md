## Location

The event will be held at the <a class="http" href="http://www.uga.edu/visit/directions.html">University of Georgia</a> at Athens. 

We have a block of rooms for the conference reserved at the <a class="http" href="http://www.georgiacenter.uga.edu/index.phtml">Georgia Center</a> on campus.  They already have a list of confirmed participants, but everyone should confirm their arrival/departure date with the reservations office by calling (706) 542-1181 and mentioning either that you are with "SAGE Days" or event number 68207.  Only single rooms are available, and all rooms are non-smoking. 


## How to get to UGA

The preferred way of getting to Athens is to fly into Atlanta (ATL), and then take the <a class="http" href="http://www.aaaairportexpress.com/routes/athens.html">AAA Shuttle express</a> shuttle to the Georgia center.  The shuttle takes about 1.5 hours and costs about $45 each way.  Since the shuttle sometimes fills up, it is recommended that you call ahead and make both arrival and departure reservations.  The shuttle phone number is (800) 354-7874 or (404) 767-2000. 

We recommend that you arrive on Friday Feb 27th, and there will be an informal dinner at a local restaurant for those who arrive on/before the 4:45pm shuttle (arrives 6:30pm to UGA).
