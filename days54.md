= Sage Days: Sage Developer Days =

== November 4â€“8, 2013, University of California Davis, USA ==

The aim of this workshop is for developers to learn the new git workflow, and to try and integrate the combinat queue into git. This workshop will '''not''' include beginner topics, but instead assumes participants are familiar with Sage development. We will have an introductory talk on Sage for newcomers on Tuesday afternoon.

=== Projects ===

The general topics that will be addressed at this workshop are the following:

 * Discussion of the new Sage workflow using git.

 * Work on how to integrate the combinat queue into the new workflow.

 * General bug fixes.

Please make sure you have a working Git-version of Sage installed on your computer before
you arrive. You can either download a version from Github, for instructions see

 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/QuickStartSageGit|Instruction on how to install Git-Sage]]

For people not yet familiar with Git, we recommend starting from a source distribution. You can find a version here

 * [[http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/ohanar/sage-git/sage-5.12.beta5.tar.gz | Source distribution of Git-Sage]]

Just download, untar, and run make (like you do with the mercurial based source tarballs).
