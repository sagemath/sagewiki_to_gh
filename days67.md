= Sage Days 67: PyCon 2015 =

'''Monday april, 13: !PyCon sprints on room 512d'''

== General Information ==

[[https://us.pycon.org/2015|PyCon]] is the largest gathering of the python community. The 2015 session is held in Montreal on April 8-16. Sage Days 67 are a satellite event which will occur on April 13-16, during the !PyCon sprints.

You can participate to both !PyCon and Sage-Days or only to Sage-Days. We invite every member of the community to join, especially students and Sage newbies. 

These Sage-Days are not specialized in one specific mathematical topic: the idea is to discover the different functionalities of Sage and the different development (basic and advanced) that take place within Sage to improve mathematical research. It is also a good place to initiate a development project on some missing functionalities. And last but not least, it is the perfect place to meet and discuss with other python open-source communities which will be attending !PyCon (IPython, !SciPy, ...).

=== When & Where ===

'''Monday april, 13: !PyCon sprints on room 512d'''

Sage-Days 67 will be held in '''UQAM''' AND '''Montreal Convention center''' (Palais des congrès)  during the 2015 !PyCon sprints '''April 13-16''', it is a satellite event to !PyCon which is organized as follows:

 * April 8-9 Tutorials
 * April 10-12 Main conference
 * April 13-16 !PyCon sprints / Sage Days 67

All !PyCon related events will happen at the '''Montreal Convention center''' (Palais des congrès): [[https://us.pycon.org/2015/venue/]]

The Sage Days talks will happen in '''UQAM''':

Pavillon Président-Kennedy
201, Président-Kennedy,
3rd floor, room PK-3605

(it's a 10 minutes walk between Palais des Congrès and UQAM)

=== Registration ===

You can regsiter to both !PyCon and Sage Days or only to Sage Days.

Participation to !PyCon ''sprints'' and Sage Days is '''free of charge'''. To register to Sage Days, please send an email to viviane.pons@lri.fr or add your name on the list of participants. Please specify if you're also attending the main !PyCon conference. 

Registration to !PyCon main conference (April 10-12) is &#36;350 for individual rate (&#36;125 for student). Please note that you can apply for financial aid, don't let the price stop you from attending! Please register on [[https://us.pycon.org/2015/|PyCon website]] and specify that you will be attending the sprints. 

=== Financial Aid ===

'''Deadline for financial aid application: January 1st, 2015'''

You can apply for financial aid '''until January 1st''' through the global !PyCon event on the [[https://us.pycon.org/2015/|PyCon website]] to cover your admission, travel and local costs. This is aimed to people attending the main conference, so you would be attending both !PyCon and Sage Days. Note that the !PyCon financial assistance includes many diversity outreach programs through [[http://www.pyladies.com/|PyLadies]], [[http://www.codechix.org/|CodeChix]], and [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups|Python User Groups]] to attract new speakers, students, and attendees. Read more about the philosophy of [[https://us.pycon.org/2014/assistance/|PyCon financial assistance]].

Please mention in your financial aid application that you wish to attend the Sage days.

=== Lodging, transportations etc. ===

You will find all practical details about the venue on the [[https://us.pycon.org/2015/|PyCon website]].

=== How can I get started developing Sage really, really quickly? ===

Use the [[http://cloud.sagemath.com|SageMathCloud]]! You should only have to copy a folder into your own project (a few minutes) and then have everything you need to begin Sage development work immediately. For instructions, see [[https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/53b77207-8614-4086-a032-432af4b4cdbd/files/sage-dev-images|Sage Source and SMC binaries]]. (This is a new and experimental process.)

=== What are the coding sprints? ===

Coding Sprints are "free coding time" where everyone can work on their own projects: from following introduction tutorials to implementing advanced functionalities. It can be done individually or in small groups. It is the perfect place to start a group project on mathematical functionalities that one wants to have in Sage.

It is not reserved to advanced developers! As a new comer, it gives you a great opportunity to start using Sage and implementing the computation you need surrounded by advanced developers who can help you if you encounter some problems. 

The coding sprints will be held at !PyCon as a !PyCon sprint project. This means there will be many other (non sage) developers working on lots of open source python projects. Please, feel free to "look around".
