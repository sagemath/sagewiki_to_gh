= Sage Days 67: PyCon 2015 =

== General Information ==

[[https://us.pycon.org/2015|PyCon]] is the largest gathering of the python community. The 2015 session is held in Montreal on April 8-16. Sage Days 67 are a satellite event which will occur on April 13-16, during the !PyCon sprints.

You can participate to both !PyCon and Sage-Days or only to Sage-Days. We invite every member of the community to join, especially students and Sage newbies. 

These Sage-Days are not specialized in one specific mathematical topic: the idea is to discover the different functionalities of Sage and the different development (basic and advanced) that take place within Sage to improve mathematical research. It is also a good place to initiate a development project on some missing functionalities. And last but not least, it is the perfect place to meet and discuss with other python open-source communities which will be attending !PyCon (IPython, !SciPy, ...).

=== When & Where ===

Sage-Days 67 will be held in '''Montreal Convention center''' (Palais des congrès)  and /or at the UQAM during the 2015 !PyCon sprints '''April 13-16''', it is a satellite event to !PyCon which is organized as follows:

 * April 8-9 Tutorials
 * April 10-12 Main conference
 * April 13-16 !PyCon sprints / Sage Days 67

=== Registration ===

You can regsiter to both !PyCon and Sage Days or only to Sage Days.

Participation to !PyCon ''sprints'' and Sage Days is '''free of charge'''. To register to Sage Days, please send an email to viviane.pons@lri.fr or add your name on the list of participants. Please specify if you're also attending the main !PyCon conference.

Please register on [[https://us.pycon.org/2015/|PyCon website]] and specify that you will be attending the sprints. 

=== Financial Aid ===

'''Deadline for financial aid application: January 1st, 2015'''

You can apply for financial aid '''until January 1st''' through the global !PyCon event on the [[https://us.pycon.org/2015/|PyCon website]] to cover your admission, travel and local costs. This is aimed to people attending the main conference, so you would be attending both !PyCon and Sage Days. Note that the !PyCon financial assistance includes many diversity outreach programs through [[http://www.pyladies.com/|PyLadies]], [[http://www.codechix.org/|CodeChix]], and [[http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups|Python User Groups]] to attract new speakers, students, and attendees.
