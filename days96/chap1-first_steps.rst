The three golden rules
----------------------

Recall from the introduction the three most import things.

First, to execute a cell on which you have the focus press Shift-Enter.

Second, to access the documentation add a question mark `?` at the end
and press enter::

    sage: is_prime?

Third, to obtain the list of methods that starts with a given prefix, press
the tab key::

    sage: is_pr

Objects, functions, methods
---------------------------

Most names in Sage are either in *snake case* like ``bernoulli``,
``is_prime``, ``cos``, ... or *camel case* like
``VectorSpace``, ``PolynomialRing``, ``Matrix``, ... The
snake case notation is mostly reserved to functions

::

    sage: bernoulli(13)

::

    sage: is_prime(73)

::

    sage: cos(pi/3)

While camel case are often objects, that is to say after
calling it you obtain an object that you can query further::

    sage: K = GF(5)           # the field with 5 elements
    sage: K.cardinality()     # size of K

::

    sage: V = VectorSpace(K, 3)   # vector space K^3
    sage: V.cardinality()         # size of V

Note that in the above example we used ``K.cardinality()`` that
actually meant ``cardinality(K)``. Though in many programming
languages like Python functions are bind to objects. In this
situation they are named *methods*. Most method names are in
lower case. Tab-completion also applies to methods.
For example if you write ``V.`` in a cell and press the tab
key you will get all methods appliable to ``V``.

.. sagecell

While if you write ``V.card`` and press tab, you will magically
obtain ``V.cardinality`` because this is the unique method of ``V``
starting with ``card``

.. sagecell

Exercise 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A *partition* of a nonnegative integer `n` is a non-increasing list of
positive integers with total sum `n`.

Does Sage have a command for defining a partition ?

.. sagecell


(*hint*: type ``Part`` and then hit the ``<TAB>`` key)

Create the partition with list `[4, 3, 1, 1]` and assign it to the Python
name ``p``:

.. sagecell


(*hint*: to see documentation and examples for the Permutation command, type
``Partition?``)

Find the conjugate of ``p`` (and name it ``q``):

.. sagecell


Which of ``p`` and ``q`` dominates the other ?

.. sagecell


(*hint*: to see the methods available to the partition named ``p``, you can type
``p.`` and hit ``<TAB>``)


How did Sage decide whether ``p`` dominates ``q`` ?

.. sagecell

(*hint*: to access the source code, use ``p??``)


Exercise 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find out what is the name of the function to construct
a matrix

.. sagecell

Compute the rank, the determinant and the Hermite normal form
of the following 5x5 integer matrix

.. MATH::

    \left(\begin{array}{rrrrr}
    8 & 0 & 7 & 5 & 6 \\
    9 & 0 & 6 & 9 & 4 \\
    4 & 9 & 5 & 3 & 0 \\
    6 & 9 & 4 & 9 & 3 \\
    0 & 8 & 4 & 5 & 6
    \end{array}\right)

.. sagecell

Obtain a latex code for this matrix using the function ``latex``

.. sagecell


Playing with integers
---------------------

To create an integer, simply write it in base 10 as::

    sage: 12395851

To assign the integer `14585` to a Python variable named ``n`` use::

    sage: n = 14585

Once the variable is created, you can access all its methods using
tab-completion. Write ``n.`` in the following cell and press the
tab key

.. sagecell

Exercise 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find out the name of the method on integers that give the list
of prime factors of an integer ``n``

.. sagecell

(*note*: to do that, you first need to assign an integer to a Python variable
and use tab-completion on this variable)

Solve `Euler problem 3 <https://projecteuler.net/problem=3>`_: what
is the largest prime factor of the number `600851475143`

.. sagecell

Exercise 1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the name of the function that given an integer ``n`` returns
the ``n``-th prime number

.. sagecell

Solve `Euler problem 7 <https://projecteuler.net/problem=7>`_: what is
the 100001-th prime number

.. sagecell

Exercise 1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solve `Euler problem 10 <https://projecteuler.net/problem=10>`_: what
is sum of prime numbers below two milions?

.. sagecell

(*hint*: You can use the function ``sum`` to make the sum of
elements in a list.)

Exercise 1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is the name of the method on integer that provides the list of
digits?

.. sagecell

Check that the sum of digits of `2^{15} = 32768` is `3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26`

.. sagecell

Solve `Euler problem 16 <https://projecteuler.net/problem=16>`_
and `Euler problem 20 <https://projecteuler.net/problem=20>`_

.. sagecell

Note that the comparison operators are ``==`` (for equality), ``!=`` (for
difference). You already used the sign ``=`` but for another purpose:
assignment of value to a variable.

Graphics and Symbolic functions
-------------------------------

It is often helpful to make pictures in mathematics. Sage comes with a lot
of graphical capabilities. The main commands for 2d plotting are

* ``plot``: plot an object
* ``point2d``: plot a list of points
* ``line2d``: draw a broken line between points
* ``polygon2d``: draw a polygon

For example::

    sage: plot(sin(x), (x, 0, 2*pi))

::

    sage: point2d([(0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (3,1)], color='red')

Graphics can be assigned to variables and it is possible to superimpose
them using addition::

    sage: P1 = plot(sin(x), (x, 0, 2*pi), color='blue')
    sage: P2 = plot(cos(x), (x, 0, 2*pi), color='red')
    sage: P = P1 + P2
    sage: P.show()

Note also that many objects possess a ``plot`` method that allows to produce
graphics::

    sage: m = AlternatingSignMatrices(20).random_element()
    sage: fpl = m.to_fully_packed_loop()
    sage: fpl.plot(link_color_map='rainbow')

To learn more about graphics, have a look at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html
and https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/tour_plotting.html

Exercise 1.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Draw a graphics of the function `f(x) = \sin(x) + \cos(x) - x \exp(x)` for `x`
between `0` and `1`

.. sagecell

Using the function ``find_root``, obtain an approximation of the unique
solution `r` of `f(r) = 0` with `r \in (0,1)`.

.. sagecell

Draw a graphics of `f` together with a red vertical line between `(r, -1)`
and `(r, 1)`

.. sagecell

Exercise 1.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~

What are the first 20 terms of the Taylor expansion at `x = 0` of the function
`g(x) = 1 / \sqrt{1 - 4*x}`

.. sagecell

Check on the taylor expansion that

.. MATH::

    g(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \binom{2n}{n} x^n

.. sagecell

Combinatorics
-------------

In Sage, it is possible to build set of objects such that the `alternating sign
matrices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_sign_matrix>`_ of size `100
\times 100`::

    sage: A = AlternatingSignMatrices(100)
    sage: A

Exercise 1.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~

How many alternating sign matrices of size `100 \times 100` are there?

.. sagecell

How does it compare with the number of atoms in the universe?

Exercise 1.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solve `Euler problem 24 <https://projecteuler.net/problem=24>`_: what is the
millionth lexicographic permutation of `\{0, 1, \ldots, 9\}`?

.. sagecell

Exercise 1.11
-------------

Solve `Euler problem 5 <https://projecteuler.net/problem=5>`_:
what is the smallest positive number that is divisible by all of the
numbers from 1 to 20?

.. sagecell

On the `Euler project <https://projecteuler.net>`_ website you can find mathematical
challenges to be solved with a computer. You can challenge yourself with the following
ones that do not require any programming but only to find the right Sage function
