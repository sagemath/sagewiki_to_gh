# TeXmacs support for Sage

There is a <a class="https" href="https://www.texmacs.org/">TeXmacs</a> plugin for Sage. 

After starting TeXmacs, try to add a Sage session to the current TeXmacs buffer, by doing `Insert ⇒ Session ⇒ Sage`. 

If this does not work, you might need to 

   * modify your PATH so that Sage can be found 
   * install the plugin from <a href="https://github.com/texmacs/SageMath.tm">https://github.com/texmacs/SageMath.tm</a> 
The plugin is based on the TeXmacs Python plugin by Ero Carrera.  It has support for LaTeX display, tab completion, doc string / source support, and support for displaying plots within TeXmacs. 

A screenshot from the TeXmacs Sage plugin (as of June 2020) can be seen below.
