= TeXmacs support for Sage =

There is a [[http://www.texmacs.org/|TeXmacs]] plugin for Sage.

After starting !TeXmacs, try to add a Sage session to the current !TeXmacs buffer,
by doing Insert -> Session -> Sage.

If this does not work, you might need to

  * modify your PATH so that Sage can be found
  * install the plugin from https://github.com/texmacs/SageMath.tm

The plugin is based on the !TeXmacs Python plugin by Ero Carrera.  It has support
for LaTeX display, tab completion, doc string / source support (via ? and ??),
and support for displaying plots within !TeXmacs.

Screenshots from an old version of the !TeXmacs Sage plugin can be seen below
(if you have a recent version, consider adding screenshots here).
