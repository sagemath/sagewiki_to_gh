'''CoCalc''' (for "Collaborative Calculation in the Cloud") is an online
platform which gives access via the web to virtual machines running a full
Ubuntu GNU/Linux system, with lots of free software pre-installed, especially
for mathematics and other sciences, including many programming languages
(C, C++, Haskell, Java, OCaml, Python, Scala...), mathematics software systems
(GAP, Macaulay2, Maxima, PARI/GP, R, SageMath, Singular), the Jupyter notebook
with many kernels available), support for many markup languages (HTML, LaTeX,
Markdown, TeX...), data analysis, machine learning and natural language processing
software (NLTK, Pandas, R, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, !TensorFlow), etc.

CoCalc also has collaboration features which lets users edit collaboratively
any type of document (text, markdown, TeX/LaTeX, calculation worksheets...).

CoCalc also offers course management functionality, letting users create a class,
send handouts, send and collect assignments, send out grades...

CoCalc is provided by the company "!SageMath, Inc.", founded by William Stein
to raise money in order to support the development of SageMath (the free
software for mathematics that this wiki is about).

CoCalc was initially launched under the name SageMathCloud, and hosted at
[[https://cloud.sagemath.com/|cloud.sagemath.com]] which now redirects to
[[https://cocalc.com|cocalc.com]].
In terms of domain names,  [[https://sagemath.com|sagemath.com]] is for the
company "!SageMath, Inc.", while [[https://sagemath.org|sagemath.org]] is for
the SageMath software.
