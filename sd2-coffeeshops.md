[:days2:SAGE Days 2] Coffee Shops (by Josh Kantor)

For lots of suggestions around the city take a look at http://seattle.wifimug.org/. Of course this guide is really not necessary. If you go anywhere in seattle and look around chances are you will see a coffee shop and probably two across the street from each other. That said here is a guide to the area around campus.

== Coffee Shops On Campus ==
(Both of these are about 1 minute from the communications building.)
 * There is a Tully's in the HUB food court.   No ambience, but the whole building as well as the HUB Lawn has UW wifi. (This Tully's is part of a little convenience store, good for quick coffee and a snack) TB: there's actually two -- one is "ETC", the convenience store with the Tully's which has a robotic espresso maker which is set to "swill" mode, and the other is a real Tully's with real baristas.  It's down by the windows, and hard to see from the main hub area.
 * In the basement of the Art Building there is a coffee shop (Parnassus). No wifi but nice environment. Additionally the Quad which is the grassy area adjacent to the art building should have wifi. http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html?art
 * h-bar in the physics department.  Supposedly good; I'll check their hours later.
 * Tully's-in-convenience-store in Ballmer.  Not worth the effort unless you're in danger of falling asleep on the way from Allegro to Parnassus.
 * Tom's French press -- makes 8 ounces (currently in William's office.  clean it if you use it)
 * By George: Downstairs from Odegaard.  Another Tully's-in-convenience-store with a robotic espresso maker (same settings as the one in the HUB)

== Coffee Off Campus ==
(All of these are about 10 minutes walking from the communications building except the University Zoka)
 * The Allegro: On 42nd in the alley between University Ave and 15th (the alley is by Magus books, there is a church nearby). Free wifi, good coffee, and nice environment. Large, with a fairly large number of outlets. Open till 10:30. http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?CafeAllegro. It is apparently Seattle's oldest coffe shop. Also, although it may not be obvious there is an entire 2nd story balcony available (the stairs to the balcony are on the outside of the coffee shop). 
 * Cafe on the Ave: 42nd and University Ave: Free wifi (they give you a WEP key when you buy anything). Lots of outlets, large. http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?CafeOnTheAve
 * The Sureshot: At 45th and the Ave. Free Wifi. One might say it sometimes has an edgier crowd.   7am-midnight. http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?Sureshot
 * Coffee and Comics: On 45th between the Ave and 15th (Next to the Wells Fargo). Small but neat place if you like comics. (They have comics that you can read while you're there). Free wifi plus two imacs available for public use. Open till 11 p.m M-F. 7p.m. on weekends. http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?CoffeeandComics
 * University Zoka: North of the University Village. Free wifi and lots of outlets. 6am-midnight http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?UniversityZoka. Just a warning, walking here from campus is slightly harder than to the other coffee shops as the road down to the U Village is a little steep. Also its probably about a 15 minute walk from the communications building. It's nice though.
 * There are a couple of chain coffee shops (Starbucks or Tully's) along the ave. Most do not have free wifi but it often bleeds in. In particular the starbucks at 42nd and the Ave has free wifi from multiple sources bleeding in. The starbucks in the University Village deserves mention as it is open till 1am Sun-Thur and 2am Fri-Sat. http://www.uvillage.com
 * The University bookstore: On the ave between 43rd and 45th has a coffee shop inside with free wifi (basically another chain coffee shop). Supposedly they have a fairly restrictive firewall (no SSH).
 * Solstice: On the ave between 41st and 42nd.  Notable because they serve coffee, tea, and beer! No wifi (or very weak).  http://www.cafesolstice.com. They have poor hours, i.e., they are not open late.
 * Trabant Chai Lounge: On 45th between University Ave and Brooklyn Ave (next to the movie theatre). If chai is your thing go here. Free wifi. http://seattle.wifimug.org/index.cgi?TrabantChaiLounge 


Note that the Allegro, the Cafe on the Ave, and the Starbucks at 42nd and the Ave are about 30 seconds walking from each other. The Cafe on the Ave and the Allegro are fairly large and can accommodate fairly large groups of people working together easily. ''For coding sprints, we could probably migrate the entire group to the Ave if we laid siege to these coffee shops. ''
