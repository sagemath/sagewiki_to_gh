<<Anchor(projects)>>
== Projects ==

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be:

 * Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course.
 * Preparing worksheets for a course.
 * Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library.
 * Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.
 * (wstein): Work on my free open Sage book: http://code.google.com/p/sage-power-book/

 * Organization of Sage educational resources
  * rating of worksheets?
  * tagging, organization of available options
  * suggestion from chemistry: set up committees to curate resources so that faculty get service credit
