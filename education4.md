== Funding ==

We only have enough funding for participants from the test sites for the NSF UTMOST project and for a few "outside" speakers.  The concurrent [[days41|Sage Days 41]] workshop has ample funding for those interested in working all week on projects related to the notebook.  However, anyone with an interest in the use of Sage in educational settings is welcome, and encouraged to attend.

== Important: Lodging ==

There is limited availability of hotel rooms in the area close to campus.  You will want to make your own arrangements immediately for a room, since we have been unable to reserve a block at any one hotel.  Suggestions are available at the [[days41/travel#hotels|travel]] page.

<<Anchor(mailinglist)>>
== Mailing Lists ==

 * The mailing list for [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sagedays41|Sage Days 41]],  will be used for Education Days also (once created).  Please add yourself to this list if you are not already on it.  This will be the primary vehicle for announcements, and last-minute changes during the week.

 * There is also a list specifically for discussing [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu|education and Sage]].

<<Anchor(irc)>>
== IRC ==

 * There is an IRC channel for sage days: #sagemath-days on irc.freenode.net. Feel free to join to discuss whatever...   For those without IRC clients, http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sagemath,sagemath-days

<<Anchor(projects)>>
== Projects ==

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be:

 * Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course.
 * Preparing worksheets for a course.
 * Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library.
 * Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.
 * (wstein): Work on my free open Sage book: http://code.google.com/p/sage-power-book/

 * Organization of Sage educational resources
  * rating of worksheets?
  * tagging, organization of available options
  * suggestion from chemistry: set up committees to curate resources so that faculty get service credit
