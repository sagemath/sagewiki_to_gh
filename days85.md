## Announcement

In 2016, we ran a one-week long <a class="https" href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77">Sage developers days</a> in a <a class="http" href="http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/de-toren/">cosy guest house</a> in Cernay, just short of an hour from Paris by public transport, on *packaging, portability, and documentation tools for Sage*. It was fun and productive and we are organizing a follow up: same location, same themes. In addition, the workshop will host a GAP coding sprint, and we are looking forward collaboration opportunities. 

If you are interested in participating, please fill/edit the <a class="https" href="https://framadate.org/UuaAiTczyBfEoaeu">poll</a> with the dates you would be coming, and fill in the <a class="https" href="https://www.lri.fr/etherpad/p/sage-days85-participants">participants list</a>. See below for the cooking organization. 

Notes: 

* unlike last year, only one guest house was available for rental; overflow will be in a nearby appartment; camping on the spot is possible too. 
* The guest house is actually rented Saturday to Saturday; everybody is welcome to stay for the whole time 

## Funding

The workshop is funded by <a class="http" href="http://opendreamkit.org/">OpenDreamKit</a>, with material help from the Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, the Mathematics and the Computer Science Departments at Université Paris-Sud, Orsay. Accommodation and meals for all participants are covered by our funding sources. OpenDreamKit participants should cover their travel expenses. We could fund the travel of some developers with specific skills and experience on the themes of the workshop. Please get in touch!

## Practical information


### Venue

The workshop takes place in a guest house, which has comfortable working spaces, a cooking and dining area, and a few bedrooms. This favors an intense workshop, with everything taking place in the same location. 

Technically speaking, the guest house is rented from Saturday to Satur 

We will set up a wired internet connection and an open wifi. 

The Tower can accommodate 10 people. 

The surrounding area offers nice hiking possibilities -- bring hiking/climbing shoes. 

Your music instruments and scores, card or board games, etc, are also welcome for the breaks. 


### Meal organisation

Meals are cooked in turns by the participants for everyone, so bring along your favorite recipes and dishes! All diets (vegetarian, ...) will be taken into account.
