= Sage Days 85, March 2017 (tentative): packaging, portability, documentation tools =

Last year we ran a one-week long [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77|Sage developers days]] in Cernay, near Paris, on packaging, portability, and documentation tools for Sage:

It was fun and productive and we are considering organizing a follow up, on similar themes, tentatively as Sage Days 85. Due to various constraints, this would have to be in March. If you are interested in participating, please fill in the [[https://framadate.org/UuaAiTczyBfEoaeu|poll]] to help us select the dates:

Through ODK, we have funding for local expenses for all participants, and could fund the travel of some developers with experience or specific interest on the above themes. Please get in touch with me!

Feel free to spread the news and suggest other themes (by mail or here) as well.
