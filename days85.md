<<TableOfContents()>>

== Announcement ==

In 2016, we ran a one-week long
[[https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77|Sage developers days]] in
a [[http://www.cernayvacances.com/en/stay/de-toren/|cosy guest house]]
in Cernay, just short of an hour from Paris by public transport,
on *packaging, portability, and documentation tools for
Sage*. It was fun and productive and we are organizing a follow up:
same location, same themes. In addition, the workshop will host a GAP
coding sprint, and we are looking forward collaboration opportunities.

If you are interested in participating, please fill/edit the
[[https://framadate.org/UuaAiTczyBfEoaeu|poll]] with the dates you
would be coming.

Notes:

 * unlike last year, only one guest house was available for rental; therefore, there will be limited space; late registered may need to sleep in a tent; you are warned :-)

 * The guest house is actually rented Saturday to Saturday; everybody is welcome to stay for the whole time

== Funding ==

The workshop is funded by [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]],
with material help from the Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique,
the Mathematics and the Computer Science Departments at Université
Paris-Sud, Orsay. Accommodation and meals for all participants are
covered by our funding sources. !OpenDreamKit participants should
cover their travel expenses. We could fund the travel of some
developers with specific skills and experience on the themes of the
workshop. Please get in touch!

== Programme and topics ==

See the [[https://www.lri.fr/etherpad/p/sage-days85|pad]].

== Practical information ==

=== Venue ===

The workshop takes place in a guest house, which has comfortable working spaces,
a cooking and dining area, and a few bedrooms. This favors an intense workshop,
with everything taking place in the same location.

Technically speaking, the guest house is rented from Saturday to Satur

We will set up a wired internet connection and an open wifi.

The Tower can accommodate 10 people.

The surrounding area offers nice hiking possibilities -- bring hiking/climbing shoes.

Your music instruments and scores, card or board games, etc, are also welcome for the breaks.

=== Meal organisation ===

Meals are cooked in turns by the participants for everyone, so bring along your
favorite recipes and dishes! All diets, including vegetarian, will be taken into
account.

The organizers will do some large shopping before coming, and then we
will complement locally, as needed. Please edit below or send us the
list of ingredients for the dish(es) you plan to prepare. We will be
roughtly 10-15 and should plan for roughly 10 meals.
