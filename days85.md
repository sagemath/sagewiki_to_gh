= Sage/GAP Days 85, March 13-17 of 2017: packaging, portability, documentation tools =

In 2016, we ran a one-week long [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/days77|Sage developers days]] in Cernay, near Paris, on packaging, portability, and documentation tools for Sage. It was fun and productive and we are organizing a follow up; same location, same themes.

In addition, the workshop will host a GAP coding sprint, and we are looking forward collaboration opportunities.

If you are interested in participating, please fill/edit the [[https://framadate.org/UuaAiTczyBfEoaeu|poll]] with the dates you would be coming.

Note: unlike last year, only one house was available for rental; therefore, there will be limited space; late registerers may need to sleep in a tent :-)

Through ODK, we have funding for local expenses for all participants, and could fund the travel of some developers with experience or specific interest on the above themes. Please get in touch with me!
