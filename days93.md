= Sage days 93: Lattices in Lie groups =

This is the page for Sage days 93 (also involving PARI and GAP) about "Lattices in Lie groups". The aim is to bring together experts in the area (Lie groups / algebras, hyperbolic geometry, lattices, Coxeter groups,...) and software developers (Sage, GAP, SnapPy, Magma,...), that can work to improve the functionality of Sage or other open source packages, as well as the interaction among them.

The workshop will be held at Faber Residency (www.faberresidency.com), in Olot (https://goo.gl/maps/fBVWA8U2ncr).

Note that although the workshop will run for two weeks, it is possible to attend to only part of the workshop.

The conditions of the Faber residencies require that the participants propose activities mainly aimed at high school students, that can be carried out in English, Catalan or Spanish.
