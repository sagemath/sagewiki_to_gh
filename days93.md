= GAP-PARI-Sage days 93: Subgroups and lattices of Lie groups =
== 19th february - 4th march 2018 ==

This is the page for a joint GAP-PARI-Sage workshop (number 93 as a Sage days). The theme is about "Subgroups and lattices of Lie groups". The aim is to bring together experts in the area (Lie groups / algebras, (real and complex) hyperbolic geometry, symmetric spaces, lattices, Coxeter groups, ...) and software developers (GAP, PARI/GP, Sage but also !SnapPy, Magma,...) that can work to improve the functionality of open source packages as well as the interactions among them.

The workshop will be held at [[http://faberresidency.com/|Faber Residency]] in Olot, Catalunya (map at https://goo.gl/maps/fBVWA8U2ncr).

Note that although the workshop will run for two weeks, it is possible to attend to only part of the workshop.

The conditions of the Faber residencies require that the participants propose activities mainly aimed at high school students, that can be carried out in English, Catalan or Spanish.

If you are interested in attending the workshop, get in contact with the organizers. The cost for semi-pension (hotel + breakfast + dinner) is only 40â‚¬ per day thanks to Faber. Some fundings is available via the [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit European grant]] and can be requested to the organizers.
