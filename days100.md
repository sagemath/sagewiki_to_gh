The Sage days 100 workshop will take place in Bonn Germany, July 22nd - July 26th. It welcomes anyone who wishes to work with Sage, from complete beginners to advanced developers.

There will be one day in the week dedicated to present Sage at Bonn University or Max-Planck Institut (for students, PhD students, postdocs and professors). If you intend to come to this workshop, you are welcome to be involved in this.
