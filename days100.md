Combinatorics, geometry and dynamics on real surfaces (complex curves). Here is a non-exhaustive list

 * moduli space of curves, differentials, spin structures
 * enumerative geometry, integral points in polytopes and (quasi-)modular forms
 * geometry and dynamics of flat and hyperbolic surfaces
 * braid groups, mapping class groups
