Tuesday
-------

 **Morning Session**:

 * 08h30 : Coffee & Croissants
 * 09h00 : `Øyvind Solberg`__, *Quivers and Path Algebras - QPA* (`slides`__ and `demo`__)

            *Abstract*. We will give an introduction representation theory of
            quivers, defining quivers (directed graphs), representations of
            quivers and maps between representations of quivers. Further to
            recall basic constructions involving these objects like direct sum,
            kernels, special representations, etc.  Representations of quivers
            are central for representation theory of finite dimensional
            algebras, and we will try to describe some of the basic problems.

            Next we describe the QPA project by describing the background, aims
            and goals, current status, design and algorithms, and main future
            projects.

            We will end with a short demonstration of the QPA program,
            hopefully run via an interface developed by students at HiST/NTNU.

 * 10h00 : Coffee Break
 * 10h30 : Nicolas M. Thiéry, *A Sage-Combinat roadmap*

            *Abstract.* In this talk, we will present the Sage-Combinat
            project, whose mission is "to improve Sage as an extensible toolbox
            for computer exploration in (algebraic) combinatorics, and foster
            code sharing between researchers in this area". After a brief tour
            of its history and development model, we will focus on its roadmap,
            opening a discussion on what mid to long term goals could be,
            depending on interest and available work forces.

 * 11h30 : `Meinolf Geck`__, *High performance computations around Kazhdan-Lusztig cells*

            *Abstract.*  We present the computer algebra package PyCox, written
            entirely in Python and compatible with Sage, for computations with
            finite Coxeter groups and Hecke algebras. It includes some new
            variations of the traditional algorithms for computing Kazhdan-Lusztig
            cells (which now work up to type E_7) and distinguished involutions
            (which even work in type E_8).

 **Morning Session**:

 * 08h30 : Coffee & Croissants
 * 09h00 : Derek Ruths, `Introducing Zen: the Zero-Effort Network Library for Python`_

            *Abstract.* This talk will introduce a new python library for network
            analysis and algorithmics.  As datasets increase in size and algorithms
            demand increasing amounts of resources, it is critically important for
            network libraries to be efficient and performant.  Few libraries
            available for Python (or any other platform for that matter) deliver
            this kind of efficiency: few can load massive network datasets or
            execute intensive algorithms on them.  Of those that can, efficiency
            comes at a cost to ease of use.  We don't believe that this compromise
            is necessary. Designed from scratch, the Zen library aims to provide the
            fastest, most memory efficient network routines without compromising
            good pythonic conventions.  To date it's benchmarked network functions
            match or beat the fastest network libraries available in Python.  In
            this talk, we will give a brief introduction to network analysis,
            discuss the design elements of Zen that make it both fast and
            easy-to-use, briefly overview its functionality, and discuss
            opportunities for integration and use with Sage.

 * 10h00 : Coffee Break
 * 10h30 : Anne Schilling, *Markov chains for promotion operators*, (`Sage worksheet`__)

            *Abstract.* Schuetzenberger introduced a promotion operator on
            arbitrary finite posets. Using a slight extension of these
            operators, one can define a Markov chain on all linear extensions
            of the poset. This generalizes the Tsetlin library which
            corresponds to the antichain. With Sage, we can investigate the
            stationary distributions and eigenvalues of the transition matrix.
            For rooted forests we find that the resulting monoid is R-trivial,
            which leads to a generalization of Brown's theory of Markov chains
            for left regular bands. This is based on mathematical explorations with
            Arvind Ayyer and Steven Klee, and the patch 
            `Trac 12536`_ with Nicolas Thiery.

 * 11h00 : Viviane Pons, *Bases of multivariate polynomials*, (`Sage worksheet`__)

            *Abstract.* We have developed a patch in sage to consider
            multivariate polynomials as formal sums of vectors. Each vector
            corresponds to the exponent of a monomial. From simple operations
            on vectors, we obtain operations on the polynomials. We define the
            *divided differences* and we explain how they can be used to
            generate linear bases of the ring of multivariate polynomials. We
            show that they can be seen as a generalization of the Schur basis
            of symmetric polynomials.
