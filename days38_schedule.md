-------

 **Morning Session**:

 * 11h30 : Meinolf Geck, *High performance computations around Kazhdan-Lusztig cells*

            *Abstract.*  We present the computer algebra package PyCox, written
            entirely in Python and compatible with Sage, for computations with
            finite Coxeter groups and Hecke algebras. It includes some new
            variations of the traditional algorithms for computing Kazhdan-Lusztig
            cells (which now work up to type E_7) and distinguished involutions
            (which even work in type E_8).

 **Afternoon Session**, 14h30-17h30: exercises and coding sprints with coffee break and status reports

Wednesday

 **Morning Session**:

 * 08h30 : Coffee & Croissants
 * 09h00 : Derek Ruths, *Introducing Zen: the Zero-Effort Network Library for Python*

            *Abstract.* This talk will introduce a new python library for network
            analysis and algorithmics.  As datasets increase in size and algorithms
            demand increasing amounts of resources, it is critically important for
            network libraries to be efficient and performant.  Few libraries
            available for Python (or any other platform for that matter) deliver
            this kind of efficiency: few can load massive network datasets or
            execute intensive algorithms on them.  Of those that can, efficiency
            comes at a cost to ease of use.  We don't believe that this compromise
            is necessary. Designed from scratch, the Zen library aims to provide the
            fastest, most memory efficient network routines without compromising
            good pythonic conventions.  To date it's benchmarked network functions
            match or beat the fastest network libraries available in Python.  In
            this talk, we will give a brief introduction to network analysis,
            discuss the design elements of Zen that make it both fast and
            easy-to-use, briefly overview its functionality, and discuss
            opportunities for integration and use with Sage.
