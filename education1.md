= Sage Education Day 1 =

 The first [[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage]] Education Day is being held with the generous cooperation of the organizers of [[dayscambridge2|Sage Days 18]].

== Topics ==

 * Intro to using Sage for math in the classroom

 * Using Sage in specific courses (multivariable calculus and group theory - tentative)

 * Intro to the [[http://lurch.sourceforge.net/|Lurch]] math proof software project

 * Sage implementation in the classroom - logistics and more

 * Roundtable discussions on general math software, and on math and word processing - for both, what works and what doesn't

See [[#schedule|below]] for the official schedule.

== Logistics ==
  
 * Date and Location: December 5, 2009 at the Clay Mathematics Institute (Cambridge, MA), from 9:30 AM to 2:30 PM, with a lunch break from 12:30-1:30. 

 * Driving directions can be found at the [[http://www.claymath.org/visitors/|Official Clay Mathematics Institute Visitors Page]]. Parking meters of the coin-operated (quarters only) and "pay and display" varieties (which accept credit cards) run 8 AM-6 PM on Saturday, and most in Harvard Square are limited to 2 hours. For off-street parking, see [[http://www.harvardsquare.com/maps.aspx|this map]]; bring receipts to Kiran for parking reimbursement.

 * Public transit is an excellent alternative to driving; CMI is a 5-minute walk from the Harvard Square T station. For complete directions, see the [[http://www.claymath.org/visitors/|CMI Visitors Page]]. (Harvard is on the Red Line; a nearby station with plenty of parking is Alewife.)

 * We strongly encourage you to bring your laptop to try things out!  Wifi will be available.

 * [[#registration|Registration]] and light refreshments start at 9:00 AM.  Lunch is on your own, but we will probably go in groups to continue the discussion.

== Mailing Lists ==

 * The list for this event is [[http://groups.google.com/group/sageday18|here]].

 * There is also a list specifically for discussing [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu|education issues in Sage]].

 * You may also find the general Sage [[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support|support list]] helpful.

== Organizers ==
 * Nathan Carter ([[http://www.bentley.edu/|Bentley]])
 * Karl-Dieter Crisman ([[http://www.gordon.edu/|Gordon]])

== Registration ==

There are several ways to register.  

 * Send an email to one of the organizers (addresses available on their home pages below),
 * Put your name on the list below of confirmed participants, or
 * Just show up!

CMI would also like all participants to register with them. This can be done when you arrive, but it will save a bit of time to email Amanda Battese (battese@claymath.org) with your name, email address, and institutional affilation.
