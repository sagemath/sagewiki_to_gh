# Sage Education Day 1

* The first <a class="http" href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a> Education Day was held on December 5, 2009, with the generous cooperation of the organizers of <a href="/dayscambridge2">Sage Days 18</a>. 

## Topics

* Intro to using Sage for math in the classroom 
* Using Sage in specific courses (multivariable calculus and group theory - tentative) 
* Intro to the <a class="http" href="http://lurch.sourceforge.net/">Lurch</a> math proof software project 
* Sage implementation in the classroom - logistics and more 
* Roundtable discussions on general math software, and on math and word processing - for both, what works and what doesn't 
See <a href="/education1#schedule">below</a> for the official schedule and links to resources related to the talks (slides, worksheets, etc.). 


## Logistics

* Date and Location: December 5, 2009 at the Clay Mathematics Institute (Cambridge, MA), from 9:30 AM to 2:30 PM, with a lunch break from 12:30-1:30.  
* Driving directions can be found at the <a class="http" href="http://www.claymath.org/visitors/">Official Clay Mathematics Institute Visitors Page</a>. Parking meters of the coin-operated (quarters only) and "pay and display" varieties (which accept credit cards) run 8 AM-6 PM on Saturday, and most in Harvard Square are limited to 2 hours. For off-street parking, see <a class="http" href="http://www.harvardsquare.com/maps.aspx">this map</a>; bring receipts to Kiran for parking reimbursement. 
* Public transit is an excellent alternative to driving; CMI is a 5-minute walk from the Harvard Square T station. For complete directions, see the <a class="http" href="http://www.claymath.org/visitors/">CMI Visitors Page</a>. (Harvard is on the Red Line; a nearby station with plenty of parking is Alewife.) 
* We strongly encourage you to bring your laptop to try things out!  Wifi will be available. 
* <a href="/education1#registration">Registration</a> and light refreshments start at 9:00 AM.  Lunch is on your own, but we will probably go in groups to continue the discussion. 

## Mailing Lists

* The list for this event is <a class="http" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sageday18">here</a>. 
* There is also a list specifically for discussing <a class="http" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-edu">education issues in Sage</a>. 
* You may also find the general Sage <a class="http" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support">support list</a> helpful. 

## Organizers

* Nathan Carter (<a class="http" href="http://www.bentley.edu/">Bentley</a>) 
* Karl-Dieter Crisman (<a class="http" href="http://www.gordon.edu/">Gordon</a>)

## Registration

There are several ways to register.   

* Send an email to one of the organizers (addresses available on their home pages below), 
* Put your name on the list below of confirmed participants, or 
* Just show up! 
CMI would also like all participants to register with them. This can be done when you arrive, but it will save a bit of time to email Amanda Battese (<a href="mailto:battese@claymath.org">battese@claymath.org</a>) with your name, email address, and institutional affilation.

## Official Schedule

We will mostly follow <a class="http" href="http://www.claymath.org/workshops/sage/">the official schedule</a>, but it has some built-in flexibility to accommodate workshop participant interest.  Here we include a little extra detail on the sessions, beyond what is available on the official website.  The links here are variously to Sage worksheets, talk files, or other useful items.  In addition, videos (raw footage, not encoded) of most of the talks are available <a class="http" href="http://wstein.org/sagedays18/day5/">here</a>.
