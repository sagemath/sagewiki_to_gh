= Sage Education Day 1 =

 The first [[http://www.sagemath.org|Sage]] Education Day is being held with the generous cooperation of the organizers of [[dayscambridge2|Sage Days 18]].

== Topics ==
  
 * Intro to using Sage for math in the classroom

 * Using Sage with calculus (tentative topic)

 * Sage implementation in the classroom - logistics and more

 * Intro to the [[http://lurch.sourceforge.net/|Lurch]] math proof software project

 * Roundtable discussions on general math software, and on math and word processing - for both, what works and what doesn't

== Logistics ==
  
 * Date and Location: December 5, 2009 at the Clay Mathematics Institute (Cambridge, MA), from 9:30 AM to 2:30 PM, with a lunch break from 12:30-1:30. 

 * Driving Directions can be found at the [[http://www.claymath.org/visitors/|Official Clay Mathematics Institute Visitors Page]]. Parking meters run on Saturday, and most in Harvard Square are for 2 hours. For off-street parking, see [[http://www.harvardsquare.com/maps.aspx|this map]]. (Bring receipts to Kiran for reimbursement.)

 * We strongly encourage you to bring your laptop to try things out!  Wifi will be available.
