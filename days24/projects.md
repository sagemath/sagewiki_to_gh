This is a list of projects suitable for [[days24|Sage Days 24]]. Feel free to add your favourite ideas/wishes, and to put your name down for something you're interested in (you'll need to get an account on the wiki to do this).

== Kovacic's Algorithm ==

'''People:''' Burcin Erocal

Implement Kovacic's algorithm in Sage.

== Hypergeometric Functions ==

'''People:''' Flavia Stan, Karen Kohl, Fredrik Johansson

== Plural support ==

'''People:''' Burcin Erocal

Add support for Singular's noncommutative component Plural, finish [[http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/4539|#4539]].

== Locapal support ==

'''People:''' Burcin Erocal

There is experimental support for computing Groebner bases over certain localizations of operator algebras in Singular. See [[http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Viktor.Levandovskyy/filez/singular/levandovskyy_kl.pdf|this presentation]] for more details. Support for arithmetic needs to be provided in Sage.

== Parallel Integration ==

'''People:''' Burcin Erocal

Integrate Stefan Boettner's parallel integration code in Sage. There are several prerequisites for this, such as
 * algebraic function fields (transcendence degree > 1)
 * differential rings/fields
 * proper to_polynomial(), to_rational() functions for symbolic expressions

== Algorithmic/Automatic Differentiation ==

'''People:''' William Stein

I never thought much of this topic, but there is [[http://www.euroscipy.org/talk/2045|a talk at Euroscipy]] suggesting it could be useful.    [[/ad|More details here.]]
