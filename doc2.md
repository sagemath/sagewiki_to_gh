= Sage Doc Day 2 =

'''Sunday, March 9, 2008'''

We will focus mostly on doctests Doc Days 2.   Our goal is to raise the coverage score for the Sage library to 50%, since this is a central goal for Sage-3.0.   We need about 1200 new doctests to get to 50% coverage.

== Meetups ==

 * Seattle: we'll be meeting at Online Coffee Company in Capitol Hill (between 14th and 15th).  Call Stein at 206-419-0925 if you have trouble finding us.

Coverage scores by module for sage-2.10.3.rc2.  I made this with the following
script run in devel/sage/sage/:
{{{
#!/usr/bin/python
import os
for D in os.listdir('.'):
    if os.path.isdir(D):
        cmd = "cd %s; sage -coverage .|tail -2"%D
        r = os.popen(cmd).read()
        r = r.lstrip()
        print D.upper() + ": " + r
}}}
