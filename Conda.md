[[https://conda.io/docs/|Conda]] packages for Linux & OSX are available through [[https://conda-forge.github.io/|conda-forge]].

= Setting Up =

In short: Install `sage` from conda-forge.

To install sage on your machine (without the need for root permissions):

 * Install [[https://conda.io/miniconda.html|Miniconda for Python 3]]
 * export your `PATH` (and `hash -r` or `rehash`)
 * Make sure your locale is UTF-8.
 * Use conda-forge packages: `conda config --add channels conda-forge; conda config --set channel_priority strict`
 * create an environment for sage: `conda create -n sage sage`
 * enter your environment: `source activate sage`
 * enjoy: `sage`

= Maintenance =

The packages necessary to run sage are developed on the github pages of conda-forge. The actual [[https://github.com/conda-forge/sage-feedstock/tree/master/recipe|sage package]] and many of its dependencies are maintained by Isuru Fernando (and a few volunteers).

= Conda for Sage Developers =

You can develop Sage without building any of its dependencies (experimental). On my machine this takes 5 minutes:

{{{
$ export SAGE_NUM_THREADS=24
$ conda install mamba
$ mamba create -n sage-build sage boost-cpp
$ conda activate sage-build
$ mamba uninstall --force sagelib
$ ./configure --prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX
$ cd src
$ python setup.py install
$ sage -c 'print(version())'
SageMath version 9.2, Release Date: 2020-10-24
}}}

= Open Issues =

== General ==
There are still some issues with Conda. Not all tests pass and some things don't work:
 * #20382
 * â€¦

== Windows ==
There is likely not going to be a working package in the near future, see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/wyaV8x5qolI/jVS4DKBvCAAJ.
