Coding sprint projects for [[days53 | Sage Days 53]].


 * Try out Sage-Git

 * Toric fibrations

   * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14880 | Trac #14880]] : p-adic gamma function 

   * Linear algebra mod n (LinBox?) -- pari does this
  
   * Kloosterman's paper on deformations of diagonal hypersurfaces -- what are strong, weak equivalence? 
  
   * Create a python object that enumerates the set of points on a toric variety over a finite field (Ursula has code to do this); then check if these points are on a hypersurface or a complete intersection
