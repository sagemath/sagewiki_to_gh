Coding sprint projects for [[days53 | Sage Days 53]].


 * Try out Sage-Git (everybody)

 * Toric fibrations (Jan, Andrey)

   * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14880 | Trac #14880]] : p-adic gamma function 

   * Linear algebra mod n -- pari does this. Write a wrapper? (Kiran)
  
   * Kloosterman's paper on deformations of diagonal hypersurfaces -- what are strong, weak equivalence? (Kiran, Adriana, Ursula)
  
   * Create a python object that enumerates the set of points on a toric variety over a finite field (Ursula has code to do this) (David) (useful for checking if these points are on a hypersurface or a complete intersection)

   * Hypersurfaces - check smoothness, nondegeneracy (where does this fail in families?) (Kiran, Adriana, Ursula, Wouter)

   * Toric elliptic curves (first, see what's done in [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13084 | Trac #13084]] to figure out what is left to do)

 * Zeta functions of hyperelliptic curves -- point-counting method in Sage to call David's code, see [[http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15148 | Trac #15148]] (Jan
