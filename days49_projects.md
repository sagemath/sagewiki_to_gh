Sage Days 49 Coding Sprint Projects
===================================

**For the main Sage Days 49 page go** `here <http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/FPSAC13>`_

Below is a list of proposed projects. Please edit and add your projects!

Combinatorics
-------------

* Implementing Stanley chromatic symmetric function for posets

  Mathieu, Eric, Alejandro, Chris

* Implementing boards for rook placements, Le diagrams
  
  Alejandro

* Flow polytopes from permutation matrices and alternating sign matrices

  Jessica, Alejandro

* Implementation of k-tableaux and kcharge

  Anne, Jennifer

* Combinatorial actions and orbit averages on posets, order polytopes, and rational functions

  Tom Roby, Darij, Jessica

* Combinatorial Species 

  Martin Rubey, Thursday and Friday only

  * code cleanup
  * generation of unlabelled objects for composition and functorial composition via a group action framework
  * multisort species (multivariate formal power series would be useful for that)
  * add code by Andrew for Gamma-species
  * support operations from symmetric function code for cycle index series

* Conclude OEIS ticket #10358 (rebase after #13701, last doctests, and make urls clickable from the notebook

Representation Theory
---------------------

* Finalize non-symmetric Macdonald polynomial patch

  Anne, Nicolas

Other
-----

* Finish CFF #14567 review (ThierryMonteil)
* Trac-ify some of the bugs found via ask.sagemath.org and discuss about better integration between those two useful tools (ThierryMonteil)
* Work on making RIF and CIF more reliable (ThierryMonteil)
* Add parallel cloning to `Sage Debian Live <http://sagedebianlive.metelu.net/>`_ USB key (ThierryMonteil)
